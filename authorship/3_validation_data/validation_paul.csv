45001001,Romans,1,1,"Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an apostle, separated unto the gospel of God,"
45001003,Romans,1,3,"Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;"
45001006,Romans,1,6,Among whom are ye also the called of Jesus Christ:
45001008,Romans,1,8,"First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world."
45001009,Romans,1,9,"For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;"
45001010,Romans,1,10,"Making request, if by any means now at length I might have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you."
45001011,Romans,1,11,"For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end ye may be established;"
45001012,Romans,1,12,"That is, that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual faith both of you and me."
45001013,Romans,1,13,"Now I would not have you ignorant, brethren, that oftentimes I purposed to come unto you, (but was let hitherto,) that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among other Gentiles."
45001014,Romans,1,14,"I am debtor both to the Greeks, and to the Barbarians; both to the wise, and to the unwise."
45001016,Romans,1,16,"For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is the power of God unto salvation to every one that believeth; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek."
45001021,Romans,1,21,"Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened."
45001022,Romans,1,22,"Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,"
45001023,Romans,1,23,"And changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and fourfooted beasts, and creeping things."
45001024,Romans,1,24,"Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves:"
45001025,Romans,1,25,"Who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen."
45001026,Romans,1,26,For this cause God gave them up unto vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:
45001027,Romans,1,27,"And likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly, and receiving in themselves that recompence of their error which was meet."
45001028,Romans,1,28,"And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;"
45001029,Romans,1,29,"Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,"
45001030,Romans,1,30,"Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,"
45002001,Romans,2,1,"Therefore thou art inexcusable, O man, whosoever thou art that judgest: for wherein thou judgest another, thou condemnest thyself; for thou that judgest doest the same things."
45002003,Romans,2,3,"And thinkest thou this, O man, that judgest them which do such things, and doest the same, that thou shalt escape the judgment of God?"
45002004,Romans,2,4,Or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering; not knowing that the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance?
45002005,Romans,2,5,But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thyself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;
45002007,Romans,2,7,"To them who by patient continuance in well doing seek for glory and honour and immortality, eternal life:"
45002008,Romans,2,8,"But unto them that are contentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, indignation and wrath,"
45002009,Romans,2,9,"Tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil, of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile;"
45002010,Romans,2,10,"But glory, honour, and peace, to every man that worketh good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:"
45002011,Romans,2,11,For there is no respect of persons with God.
45002012,Romans,2,12,For as many as have sinned without law shall also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law shall be judged by the law;
45002013,Romans,2,13,"(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified."
45002015,Romans,2,15,"Which shew the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)"
45002016,Romans,2,16,In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.
45002021,Romans,2,21,"Thou therefore which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself? thou that preachest a man should not steal, dost thou steal?"
45002023,Romans,2,23,"Thou that makest thy boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonourest thou God?"
45002024,Romans,2,24,"For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you, as it is written."
45002026,Romans,2,26,"Therefore if the uncircumcision keep the righteousness of the law, shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?"
45002028,Romans,2,28,"For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither is that circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:"
45003002,Romans,3,2,"Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the oracles of God."
45003003,Romans,3,3,For what if some did not believe? shall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect?
45003004,Romans,3,4,"God forbid: yea, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mightest be justified in thy sayings, and mightest overcome when thou art judged."
45003006,Romans,3,6,God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?
45003007,Romans,3,7,For if the truth of God hath more abounded through my lie unto his glory; why yet am I also judged as a sinner?
45003012,Romans,3,12,"They are all gone out of the way, they are together become unprofitable; there is none that doeth good, no, not one."
45003013,Romans,3,13,Their throat is an open sepulchre; with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:
45003014,Romans,3,14,Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:
45003016,Romans,3,16,Destruction and misery are in their ways:
45003017,Romans,3,17,And the way of peace have they not known:
45003018,Romans,3,18,There is no fear of God before their eyes.
45003019,Romans,3,19,"Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God."
45003022,Romans,3,22,Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe: for there is no difference:
45003024,Romans,3,24,Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:
45003026,Romans,3,26,"To declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus."
45003029,Romans,3,29,"Is he the God of the Jews only? is he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also:"
45003030,Romans,3,30,"Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, and uncircumcision through faith."
45004001,Romans,4,1,"What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, hath found?"
45004004,Romans,4,4,"Now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt."
45004005,Romans,4,5,"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness."
45004006,Romans,4,6,"Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,"
45004007,Romans,4,7,"Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered."
45004009,Romans,4,9,"Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness."
45004014,Romans,4,14,"For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:"
45004015,Romans,4,15,"Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression."
45004018,Romans,4,18,"Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be."
45004019,Romans,4,19,"And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:"
45004022,Romans,4,22,And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.
45004024,Romans,4,24,"But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;"
45004025,Romans,4,25,"Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification."
45005001,Romans,5,1,"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:"
45005002,Romans,5,2,"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God."
45005004,Romans,5,4,"And patience, experience; and experience, hope:"
45005006,Romans,5,6,"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly."
45005007,Romans,5,7,For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.
45005008,Romans,5,8,"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
45005009,Romans,5,9,"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him."
45005010,Romans,5,10,"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life."
45005011,Romans,5,11,"And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement."
45005012,Romans,5,12,"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:"
45005013,Romans,5,13,(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.
45005014,Romans,5,14,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come."
45005016,Romans,5,16,"And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification."
45005017,Romans,5,17,"For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)"
45005018,Romans,5,18,Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.
45005019,Romans,5,19,"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."
45005020,Romans,5,20,"Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:"
45006001,Romans,6,1,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?"
45006002,Romans,6,2,"God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?"
45006004,Romans,6,4,"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life."
45006009,Romans,6,9,Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.
45006010,Romans,6,10,"For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God."
45006012,Romans,6,12,"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof."
45006014,Romans,6,14,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace."
45006015,Romans,6,15,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid."
45006016,Romans,6,16,"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?"
45006017,Romans,6,17,"But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you."
45006018,Romans,6,18,"Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness."
45006019,Romans,6,19,I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.
45007001,Romans,7,1,"Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?"
45007002,Romans,7,2,"For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband."
45007003,Romans,7,3,"So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man."
45007004,Romans,7,4,"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God."
45007005,Romans,7,5,"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death."
45007006,Romans,7,6,"But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter."
45007008,Romans,7,8,"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead."
45007011,Romans,7,11,"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me."
45007012,Romans,7,12,"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good."
45007014,Romans,7,14,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin."
45007015,Romans,7,15,"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I."
45007016,Romans,7,16,"If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good."
45007018,Romans,7,18,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not."
45007019,Romans,7,19,"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do."
45007022,Romans,7,22,For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:
45007024,Romans,7,24,O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?
45007025,Romans,7,25,I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.
45008001,Romans,8,1,"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
45008004,Romans,8,4,"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit."
45008006,Romans,8,6,For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.
45008007,Romans,8,7,"Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."
45008010,Romans,8,10,"And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness."
45008011,Romans,8,11,"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you."
45008015,Romans,8,15,"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father."
45008017,Romans,8,17,"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together."
45008018,Romans,8,18,For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.
45008020,Romans,8,20,"For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,"
45008021,Romans,8,21,Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.
45008022,Romans,8,22,For we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now.
45008023,Romans,8,23,"And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body."
45008024,Romans,8,24,"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?"
45008025,Romans,8,25,"But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience wait for it."
45008028,Romans,8,28,"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose."
45008029,Romans,8,29,"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren."
45008030,Romans,8,30,"Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified."
45008032,Romans,8,32,"He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?"
45008033,Romans,8,33,Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth.
45008034,Romans,8,34,"Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us."
45008035,Romans,8,35,"Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?"
45008037,Romans,8,37,"Nay, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us."
45008039,Romans,8,39,"Nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."
45009001,Romans,9,1,"I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,"
45009004,Romans,9,4,"Who are Israelites; to whom pertaineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;"
45009009,Romans,9,9,"For this is the word of promise, At this time will I come, and Sarah shall have a son."
45009010,Romans,9,10,"And not only this; but when Rebecca also had conceived by one, even by our father Isaac;"
45009011,Romans,9,11,"(For the children being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth;)"
45009013,Romans,9,13,"As it is written, Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated."
45009014,Romans,9,14,What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
45009016,Romans,9,16,"So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that sheweth mercy."
45009018,Romans,9,18,"Therefore hath he mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth."
45009019,Romans,9,19,"Thou wilt say then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath resisted his will?"
45009020,Romans,9,20,"Nay but, O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast thou made me thus?"
45009021,Romans,9,21,"Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the same lump to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour?"
45009025,Romans,9,25,"As he saith also in Osee, I will call them my people, which were not my people; and her beloved, which was not beloved."
45009026,Romans,9,26,"And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God."
45009027,Romans,9,27,"Esaias also crieth concerning Israel, Though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved:"
45009028,Romans,9,28,"For he will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because a short work will the Lord make upon the earth."
45009029,Romans,9,29,"And as Esaias said before, Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we had been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha."
45009030,Romans,9,30,"What shall we say then? That the Gentiles, which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith."
45009033,Romans,9,33,"As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumblingstone and rock of offence: and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed."
45010003,Romans,10,3,"For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God."
45010004,Romans,10,4,For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth.
45010005,Romans,10,5,"For Moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law, That the man which doeth those things shall live by them."
45010008,Romans,10,8,"But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;"
45010014,Romans,10,14,How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?
45010017,Romans,10,17,"So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."
45010018,Romans,10,18,"But I say, Have they not heard? Yes verily, their sound went into all the earth, and their words unto the ends of the world."
45010019,Romans,10,19,"But I say, Did not Israel know? First Moses saith, I will provoke you to jealousy by them that are no people, and by a foolish nation I will anger you."
45010020,Romans,10,20,"But Esaias is very bold, and saith, I was found of them that sought me not; I was made manifest unto them that asked not after me."
45011001,Romans,11,1,"I say then, Hath God cast away his people? God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin."
45011003,Romans,11,3,"Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life."
45011004,Romans,11,4,"But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal."
45011006,Romans,11,6,"And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work."
45011007,Romans,11,7,"What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded."
45011008,Romans,11,8,"(According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day."
45011011,Romans,11,11,"I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy."
45011013,Romans,11,13,"For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:"
45011016,Romans,11,16,"For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches."
45011017,Romans,11,17,"And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;"
45011018,Romans,11,18,"Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee."
45011019,Romans,11,19,"Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in."
45011020,Romans,11,20,"Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:"
45011022,Romans,11,22,"Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off."
45011024,Romans,11,24,"For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?"
45011028,Romans,11,28,"As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes."
45011032,Romans,11,32,"For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all."
45011034,Romans,11,34,For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?
45011035,Romans,11,35,"Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?"
45011036,Romans,11,36,"For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen."
45012001,Romans,12,1,"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service."
45012005,Romans,12,5,"So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and every one members one of another."
45012006,Romans,12,6,"Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith;"
45012008,Romans,12,8,"Or he that exhorteth, on exhortation: he that giveth, let him do it with simplicity; he that ruleth, with diligence; he that sheweth mercy, with cheerfulness."
45012011,Romans,12,11,Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;
45012012,Romans,12,12,Rejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation; continuing instant in prayer;
45012013,Romans,12,13,Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.
45012015,Romans,12,15,"Rejoice with them that do rejoice, and weep with them that weep."
45012018,Romans,12,18,"If it be possible, as much as lieth in you, live peaceably with all men."
45012020,Romans,12,20,"Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head."
45013001,Romans,13,1,Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.
45013002,Romans,13,2,"Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation."
45013003,Romans,13,3,"For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same:"
45013005,Romans,13,5,"Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake."
45013007,Romans,13,7,Render therefore to all their dues: tribute to whom tribute is due; custom to whom custom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour.
45013009,Romans,13,9,"For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
45013010,Romans,13,10,Love worketh no ill to his neighbour: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
45013011,Romans,13,11,"And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep: for now is our salvation nearer than when we believed."
45013012,Romans,13,12,"The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light."
45013013,Romans,13,13,"Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying."
45014002,Romans,14,2,"For one believeth that he may eat all things: another, who is weak, eateth herbs."
45014004,Romans,14,4,"Who art thou that judgest another man's servant? to his own master he standeth or falleth. Yea, he shall be holden up: for God is able to make him stand."
45014009,Romans,14,9,"For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living."
45014011,Romans,14,11,"For it is written, As I live, saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God."
45014013,Romans,14,13,"Let us not therefore judge one another any more: but judge this rather, that no man put a stumblingblock or an occasion to fall in his brother's way."
45014015,Romans,14,15,"But if thy brother be grieved with thy meat, now walkest thou not charitably. Destroy not him with thy meat, for whom Christ died."
45014016,Romans,14,16,Let not then your good be evil spoken of:
45014017,Romans,14,17,"For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."
45014021,Romans,14,21,"It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing whereby thy brother stumbleth, or is offended, or is made weak."
45014022,Romans,14,22,Hast thou faith? have it to thyself before God. Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that thing which he alloweth.
45015004,Romans,15,4,"For whatsoever things were written aforetime were written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope."
45015007,Romans,15,7,"Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God."
45015008,Romans,15,8,"Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:"
45015011,Romans,15,11,"And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people."
45015012,Romans,15,12,"And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust."
45015016,Romans,15,16,"That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost."
45015019,Romans,15,19,"Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about unto Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ."
45015020,Romans,15,20,"Yea, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named, lest I should build upon another man's foundation:"
45015021,Romans,15,21,"But as it is written, To whom he was not spoken of, they shall see: and they that have not heard shall understand."
45015022,Romans,15,22,For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you.
45015023,Romans,15,23,"But now having no more place in these parts, and having a great desire these many years to come unto you;"
45015025,Romans,15,25,But now I go unto Jerusalem to minister unto the saints.
45015027,Romans,15,27,"It hath pleased them verily; and their debtors they are. For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister unto them in carnal things."
45015029,Romans,15,29,"And I am sure that, when I come unto you, I shall come in the fulness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ."
45015031,Romans,15,31,That I may be delivered from them that do not believe in Judaea; and that my service which I have for Jerusalem may be accepted of the saints;
45015032,Romans,15,32,"That I may come unto you with joy by the will of God, and may with you be refreshed."
45015033,Romans,15,33,Now the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
45016001,Romans,16,1,"I commend unto you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:"
45016002,Romans,16,2,"That ye receive her in the Lord, as becometh saints, and that ye assist her in whatsoever business she hath need of you: for she hath been a succourer of many, and of myself also."
45016003,Romans,16,3,Greet Priscilla and Aquila my helpers in Christ Jesus:
45016005,Romans,16,5,"Likewise greet the church that is in their house. Salute my well-beloved Epaenetus, who is the firstfruits of Achaia unto Christ."
45016006,Romans,16,6,"Greet Mary, who bestowed much labour on us."
45016007,Romans,16,7,"Salute Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen, and my fellow-prisoners, who are of note among the apostles, who also were in Christ before me."
45016008,Romans,16,8,Greet Amplias my beloved in the Lord.
45016010,Romans,16,10,Salute Apelles approved in Christ. Salute them which are of Aristobulus' household.
45016014,Romans,16,14,"Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them."
45016015,Romans,16,15,"Salute Philologus, and Julia, Nereus, and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints which are with them."
45016016,Romans,16,16,Salute one another with an holy kiss. The churches of Christ salute you.
45016018,Romans,16,18,"For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple."
45016022,Romans,16,22,"I Tertius, who wrote this epistle, salute you in the Lord."
45016025,Romans,16,25,"Now to him that is of power to stablish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,"
46001001,1 Corinthians,1,1,"Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,"
46001002,1 Corinthians,1,2,"Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both their's and our's:"
46001005,1 Corinthians,1,5,"That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;"
46001006,1 Corinthians,1,6,Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:
46001007,1 Corinthians,1,7,So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:
46001008,1 Corinthians,1,8,"Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."
46001009,1 Corinthians,1,9,"God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord."
46001012,1 Corinthians,1,12,"Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ."
46001013,1 Corinthians,1,13,Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?
46001014,1 Corinthians,1,14,"I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;"
46001015,1 Corinthians,1,15,Lest any should say that I had baptized in mine own name.
46001017,1 Corinthians,1,17,"For Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of none effect."
46001018,1 Corinthians,1,18,For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.
46001019,1 Corinthians,1,19,"For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent."
46001022,1 Corinthians,1,22,"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:"
46001026,1 Corinthians,1,26,"For ye see your calling, brethren, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:"
46001027,1 Corinthians,1,27,But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;
46001029,1 Corinthians,1,29,That no flesh should glory in his presence.
46001031,1 Corinthians,1,31,"That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
46002003,1 Corinthians,2,3,"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling."
46002004,1 Corinthians,2,4,"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:"
46002005,1 Corinthians,2,5,"That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God."
46002006,1 Corinthians,2,6,"Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:"
46002007,1 Corinthians,2,7,"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:"
46002009,1 Corinthians,2,9,"But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him."
46002010,1 Corinthians,2,10,"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God."
46002011,1 Corinthians,2,11,"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God."
46002012,1 Corinthians,2,12,"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God."
46002016,1 Corinthians,2,16,"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ."
46003001,1 Corinthians,3,1,"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ."
46003003,1 Corinthians,3,3,"For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?"
46003004,1 Corinthians,3,4,"For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?"
46003006,1 Corinthians,3,6,"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase."
46003007,1 Corinthians,3,7,"So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase."
46003010,1 Corinthians,3,10,"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon."
46003012,1 Corinthians,3,12,"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;"
46003015,1 Corinthians,3,15,"If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire."
46003017,1 Corinthians,3,17,"If any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are."
46003018,1 Corinthians,3,18,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise."
46003019,1 Corinthians,3,19,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness."
46003020,1 Corinthians,3,20,"And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain."
46003021,1 Corinthians,3,21,Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;
46003022,1 Corinthians,3,22,"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;"
46004003,1 Corinthians,4,3,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self."
46004004,1 Corinthians,4,4,For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.
46004005,1 Corinthians,4,5,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God."
46004006,1 Corinthians,4,6,"And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another."
46004007,1 Corinthians,4,7,"For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?"
46004008,1 Corinthians,4,8,"Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you."
46004009,1 Corinthians,4,9,"For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men."
46004011,1 Corinthians,4,11,"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;"
46004012,1 Corinthians,4,12,"And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:"
46004014,1 Corinthians,4,14,"I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you."
46004015,1 Corinthians,4,15,"For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel."
46004016,1 Corinthians,4,16,"Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me."
46004017,1 Corinthians,4,17,"For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church."
46004019,1 Corinthians,4,19,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power."
46004020,1 Corinthians,4,20,"For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power."
46005001,1 Corinthians,5,1,"It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife."
46005002,1 Corinthians,5,2,"And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you."
46005004,1 Corinthians,5,4,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
46005005,1 Corinthians,5,5,"To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."
46005006,1 Corinthians,5,6,Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?
46005007,1 Corinthians,5,7,"Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:"
46005010,1 Corinthians,5,10,"Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world."
46006004,1 Corinthians,6,4,"If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church."
46006005,1 Corinthians,6,5,"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?"
46006006,1 Corinthians,6,6,"But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers."
46006007,1 Corinthians,6,7,"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?"
46006008,1 Corinthians,6,8,"Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren."
46006011,1 Corinthians,6,11,"And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God."
46006012,1 Corinthians,6,12,"All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any."
46006013,1 Corinthians,6,13,"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body."
46006015,1 Corinthians,6,15,"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid."
46006019,1 Corinthians,6,19,"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?"
46007001,1 Corinthians,7,1,Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.
46007002,1 Corinthians,7,2,"Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband."
46007004,1 Corinthians,7,4,"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife."
46007005,1 Corinthians,7,5,"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency."
46007006,1 Corinthians,7,6,"But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment."
46007010,1 Corinthians,7,10,"And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:"
46007011,1 Corinthians,7,11,"But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife."
46007013,1 Corinthians,7,13,"And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him."
46007014,1 Corinthians,7,14,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy."
46007020,1 Corinthians,7,20,Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.
46007022,1 Corinthians,7,22,"For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant."
46007027,1 Corinthians,7,27,Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.
46007029,1 Corinthians,7,29,"But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;"
46007032,1 Corinthians,7,32,"But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:"
46007033,1 Corinthians,7,33,"But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife."
46007034,1 Corinthians,7,34,"There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband."
46007035,1 Corinthians,7,35,"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction."
46007036,1 Corinthians,7,36,"But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry."
46007038,1 Corinthians,7,38,So then he that giveth her in marriage doeth well; but he that giveth her not in marriage doeth better.
46008003,1 Corinthians,8,3,"But if any man love God, the same is known of him."
46008005,1 Corinthians,8,5,"For though there be that are called gods, whether in heaven or in earth, (as there be gods many, and lords many,)"
46008008,1 Corinthians,8,8,"But meat commendeth us not to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we eat not, are we the worse."
46008009,1 Corinthians,8,9,But take heed lest by any means this liberty of your's become a stumblingblock to them that are weak.
46008012,1 Corinthians,8,12,"But when ye sin so against the brethren, and wound their weak conscience, ye sin against Christ."
46008013,1 Corinthians,8,13,"Wherefore, if meat make my brother to offend, I will eat no flesh while the world standeth, lest I make my brother to offend."
46009001,1 Corinthians,9,1,Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not ye my work in the Lord?
46009004,1 Corinthians,9,4,Have we not power to eat and to drink?
46009006,1 Corinthians,9,6,"Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?"
46009007,1 Corinthians,9,7,"Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? who planteth a vineyard, and eateth not of the fruit thereof? or who feedeth a flock, and eateth not of the milk of the flock?"
46009008,1 Corinthians,9,8,Say I these things as a man? or saith not the law the same also?
46009010,1 Corinthians,9,10,"Or saith he it altogether for our sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, this is written: that he that ploweth should plow in hope; and that he that thresheth in hope should be partaker of his hope."
46009012,1 Corinthians,9,12,"If others be partakers of this power over you, are not we rather? Nevertheless we have not used this power; but suffer all things, lest we should hinder the gospel of Christ."
46009015,1 Corinthians,9,15,"But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void."
46009018,1 Corinthians,9,18,"What is my reward then? Verily that, when I preach the gospel, I may make the gospel of Christ without charge, that I abuse not my power in the gospel."
46009021,1 Corinthians,9,21,"To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law."
46009022,1 Corinthians,9,22,"To the weak became I as weak, that I might gain the weak: I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means save some."
46009023,1 Corinthians,9,23,"And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you."
46009024,1 Corinthians,9,24,"Know ye not that they which run in a race run all, but one receiveth the prize? So run, that ye may obtain."
46009025,1 Corinthians,9,25,And every man that striveth for the mastery is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible.
46009027,1 Corinthians,9,27,"But I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection: lest that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway."
46010001,1 Corinthians,10,1,"Moreover, brethren, I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;"
46010005,1 Corinthians,10,5,But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
46010008,1 Corinthians,10,8,"Neither let us commit fornication, as some of them committed, and fell in one day three and twenty thousand."
46010009,1 Corinthians,10,9,"Neither let us tempt Christ, as some of them also tempted, and were destroyed of serpents."
46010011,1 Corinthians,10,11,"Now all these things happened unto them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come."
46010012,1 Corinthians,10,12,Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall.
46010014,1 Corinthians,10,14,"Wherefore, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry."
46010016,1 Corinthians,10,16,"The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?"
46010017,1 Corinthians,10,17,"For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread."
46010018,1 Corinthians,10,18,Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?
46010019,1 Corinthians,10,19,"What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?"
46010021,1 Corinthians,10,21,"Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils: ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and of the table of devils."
46010023,1 Corinthians,10,23,"All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not."
46010025,1 Corinthians,10,25,"Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:"
46010028,1 Corinthians,10,28,"But if any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice unto idols, eat not for his sake that shewed it, and for conscience sake: for the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof:"
46010029,1 Corinthians,10,29,"Conscience, I say, not thine own, but of the other: for why is my liberty judged of another man's conscience?"
46010032,1 Corinthians,10,32,"Give none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:"
46010033,1 Corinthians,10,33,"Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved."
46011001,1 Corinthians,11,1,"Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ."
46011003,1 Corinthians,11,3,"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God."
46011004,1 Corinthians,11,4,"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head."
46011007,1 Corinthians,11,7,"For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man."
46011009,1 Corinthians,11,9,Neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man.
46011010,1 Corinthians,11,10,For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.
46011011,1 Corinthians,11,11,"Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord."
46011012,1 Corinthians,11,12,"For as the woman is of the man, even so is the man also by the woman; but all things of God."
46011014,1 Corinthians,11,14,"Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?"
46011015,1 Corinthians,11,15,"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering."
46011017,1 Corinthians,11,17,"Now in this that I declare unto you I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better, but for the worse."
46011018,1 Corinthians,11,18,"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it."
46011020,1 Corinthians,11,20,"When ye come together therefore into one place, this is not to eat the Lord's supper."
46011021,1 Corinthians,11,21,"For in eating every one taketh before other his own supper: and one is hungry, and another is drunken."
46011022,1 Corinthians,11,22,"What? have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and shame them that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you in this? I praise you not."
46011023,1 Corinthians,11,23,"For I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you, That the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread:"
46011024,1 Corinthians,11,24,"And when he had given thanks, he brake it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me."
46011025,1 Corinthians,11,25,"After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me."
46011026,1 Corinthians,11,26,"For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come."
46011029,1 Corinthians,11,29,"For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning the Lord's body."
46011031,1 Corinthians,11,31,"For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged."
46011032,1 Corinthians,11,32,"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world."
46011034,1 Corinthians,11,34,"And if any man hunger, let him eat at home; that ye come not together unto condemnation. And the rest will I set in order when I come."
46012003,1 Corinthians,12,3,"Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost."
46012005,1 Corinthians,12,5,"And there are differences of administrations, but the same Lord."
46012006,1 Corinthians,12,6,"And there are diversities of operations, but it is the same God which worketh all in all."
46012007,1 Corinthians,12,7,But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal.
46012009,1 Corinthians,12,9,To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;
46012011,1 Corinthians,12,11,"But all these worketh that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will."
46012013,1 Corinthians,12,13,"For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit."
46012015,1 Corinthians,12,15,"If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"
46012019,1 Corinthians,12,19,"And if they were all one member, where were the body?"
46012020,1 Corinthians,12,20,"But now are they many members, yet but one body."
46012021,1 Corinthians,12,21,"And the eye cannot say unto the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
46012022,1 Corinthians,12,22,"Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:"
46012023,1 Corinthians,12,23,"And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness."
46012024,1 Corinthians,12,24,"For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked."
46012025,1 Corinthians,12,25,That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.
46012027,1 Corinthians,12,27,"Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular."
46012028,1 Corinthians,12,28,"And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, diversities of tongues."
46012029,1 Corinthians,12,29,Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?
46012030,1 Corinthians,12,30,Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?
46013001,1 Corinthians,13,1,"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal."
46013005,1 Corinthians,13,5,"Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;"
46013006,1 Corinthians,13,6,"Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth;"
46013007,1 Corinthians,13,7,"Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things."
46013012,1 Corinthians,13,12,"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."
46014001,1 Corinthians,14,1,"Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy."
46014002,1 Corinthians,14,2,"For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God: for no man understandeth him; howbeit in the spirit he speaketh mysteries."
46014003,1 Corinthians,14,3,"But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort."
46014004,1 Corinthians,14,4,He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.
46014005,1 Corinthians,14,5,"I would that ye all spake with tongues but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying."
46014006,1 Corinthians,14,6,"Now, brethren, if I come unto you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?"
46014007,1 Corinthians,14,7,"And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?"
46014009,1 Corinthians,14,9,"So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air."
46014011,1 Corinthians,14,11,"Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me."
46014012,1 Corinthians,14,12,"Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church."
46014013,1 Corinthians,14,13,Wherefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.
46014014,1 Corinthians,14,14,"For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful."
46014015,1 Corinthians,14,15,"What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also."
46014016,1 Corinthians,14,16,"Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the room of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?"
46014017,1 Corinthians,14,17,"For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified."
46014018,1 Corinthians,14,18,"I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:"
46014020,1 Corinthians,14,20,"Brethren, be not children in understanding: howbeit in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men."
46014022,1 Corinthians,14,22,"Wherefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them which believe."
46014023,1 Corinthians,14,23,"If therefore the whole church be come together into one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?"
46014025,1 Corinthians,14,25,"And thus are the secrets of his heart made manifest; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you of a truth."
46014028,1 Corinthians,14,28,"But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God."
46014030,1 Corinthians,14,30,"If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace."
46014031,1 Corinthians,14,31,"For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted."
46014032,1 Corinthians,14,32,And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.
46014034,1 Corinthians,14,34,Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience as also saith the law.
46014036,1 Corinthians,14,36,What? came the word of God out from you? or came it unto you only?
46014037,1 Corinthians,14,37,"If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord."
46015005,1 Corinthians,15,5,"And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:"
46015006,1 Corinthians,15,6,"After that, he was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain unto this present, but some are fallen asleep."
46015007,1 Corinthians,15,7,"After that, he was seen of James; then of all the apostles."
46015010,1 Corinthians,15,10,"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me."
46015011,1 Corinthians,15,11,"Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed."
46015013,1 Corinthians,15,13,"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:"
46015018,1 Corinthians,15,18,Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.
46015021,1 Corinthians,15,21,"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead."
46015022,1 Corinthians,15,22,"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive."
46015024,1 Corinthians,15,24,"Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power."
46015025,1 Corinthians,15,25,"For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet."
46015027,1 Corinthians,15,27,"For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him."
46015031,1 Corinthians,15,31,"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily."
46015032,1 Corinthians,15,32,"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die."
46015033,1 Corinthians,15,33,Be not deceived: evil communications corrupt good manners.
46015034,1 Corinthians,15,34,"Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame."
46015036,1 Corinthians,15,36,"Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:"
46015037,1 Corinthians,15,37,"And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:"
46015039,1 Corinthians,15,39,"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds."
46015041,1 Corinthians,15,41,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory."
46015044,1 Corinthians,15,44,"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body."
46015045,1 Corinthians,15,45,"And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit."
46015046,1 Corinthians,15,46,"Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual."
46015048,1 Corinthians,15,48,"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly."
46015049,1 Corinthians,15,49,"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly."
46015050,1 Corinthians,15,50,"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption."
46015055,1 Corinthians,15,55,"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?"
46015057,1 Corinthians,15,57,"But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
46016002,1 Corinthians,16,2,"Upon the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come."
46016003,1 Corinthians,16,3,"And when I come, whomsoever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality unto Jerusalem."
46016005,1 Corinthians,16,5,"Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia."
46016006,1 Corinthians,16,6,"And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go."
46016007,1 Corinthians,16,7,"For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit."
46016011,1 Corinthians,16,11,"Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me: for I look for him with the brethren."
46016012,1 Corinthians,16,12,"As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come unto you with the brethren: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time."
46016013,1 Corinthians,16,13,"Watch ye, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong."
46016015,1 Corinthians,16,15,"I beseech you, brethren, (ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the firstfruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)"
46016016,1 Corinthians,16,16,"That ye submit yourselves unto such, and to every one that helpeth with us, and laboureth."
46016017,1 Corinthians,16,17,I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.
46016019,1 Corinthians,16,19,"The churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla salute you much in the Lord, with the church that is in their house."
46016020,1 Corinthians,16,20,All the brethren greet you. Greet ye one another with an holy kiss.
46016022,1 Corinthians,16,22,"If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha."
47001002,2 Corinthians,1,2,"Grace be to you and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
47001004,2 Corinthians,1,4,"Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God."
47001006,2 Corinthians,1,6,"And whether we be afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effectual in the enduring of the same sufferings which we also suffer: or whether we be comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation."
47001007,2 Corinthians,1,7,"And our hope of you is stedfast, knowing, that as ye are partakers of the sufferings, so shall ye be also of the consolation."
47001009,2 Corinthians,1,9,"But we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead:"
47001012,2 Corinthians,1,12,"For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward."
47001014,2 Corinthians,1,14,"As also ye have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as ye also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus."
47001015,2 Corinthians,1,15,"And in this confidence I was minded to come unto you before, that ye might have a second benefit;"
47001016,2 Corinthians,1,16,"And to pass by you into Macedonia, and to come again out of Macedonia unto you, and of you to be brought on my way toward Judaea."
47001017,2 Corinthians,1,17,"When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yea yea, and nay nay?"
47001019,2 Corinthians,1,19,"For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us, even by me and Silvanus and Timotheus, was not yea and nay, but in him was yea."
47001020,2 Corinthians,1,20,"For all the promises of God in him are yea, and in him Amen, unto the glory of God by us."
47001023,2 Corinthians,1,23,"Moreover I call God for a record upon my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet unto Corinth."
47002002,2 Corinthians,2,2,"For if I make you sorry, who is he then that maketh me glad, but the same which is made sorry by me?"
47002003,2 Corinthians,2,3,"And I wrote this same unto you, lest, when I came, I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice; having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all."
47002004,2 Corinthians,2,4,"For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote unto you with many tears; not that ye should be grieved, but that ye might know the love which I have more abundantly unto you."
47002005,2 Corinthians,2,5,"But if any have caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part: that I may not overcharge you all."
47002006,2 Corinthians,2,6,"Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many."
47002007,2 Corinthians,2,7,"So that contrariwise ye ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow."
47002010,2 Corinthians,2,10,"To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;"
47002011,2 Corinthians,2,11,Lest Satan should get an advantage of us: for we are not ignorant of his devices.
47002012,2 Corinthians,2,12,"Furthermore, when I came to Troas to preach Christ's gospel, and a door was opened unto me of the Lord,"
47002013,2 Corinthians,2,13,"I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from thence into Macedonia."
47002014,2 Corinthians,2,14,"Now thanks be unto God, which always causeth us to triumph in Christ, and maketh manifest the savour of his knowledge by us in every place."
47002015,2 Corinthians,2,15,"For we are unto God a sweet savour of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:"
47002016,2 Corinthians,2,16,To the one we are the savour of death unto death; and to the other the savour of life unto life. And who is sufficient for these things?
47003002,2 Corinthians,3,2,"Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:"
47003003,2 Corinthians,3,3,"Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart."
47003004,2 Corinthians,3,4,And such trust have we through Christ to God-ward:
47003005,2 Corinthians,3,5,Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think any thing as of ourselves; but our sufficiency is of God;
47003006,2 Corinthians,3,6,"Who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament; not of the letter, but of the spirit: for the letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life."
47003010,2 Corinthians,3,10,"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth."
47003014,2 Corinthians,3,14,But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.
47003015,2 Corinthians,3,15,"But even unto this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their heart."
47003018,2 Corinthians,3,18,"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord."
47004001,2 Corinthians,4,1,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;"
47004003,2 Corinthians,4,3,"But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:"
47004004,2 Corinthians,4,4,"In whom the god of this world hath blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine unto them."
47004005,2 Corinthians,4,5,"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake."
47004006,2 Corinthians,4,6,"For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
47004008,2 Corinthians,4,8,"We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;"
47004010,2 Corinthians,4,10,"Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body."
47004011,2 Corinthians,4,11,"For we which live are alway delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh."
47004012,2 Corinthians,4,12,"So then death worketh in us, but life in you."
47004016,2 Corinthians,4,16,"For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day."
47004018,2 Corinthians,4,18,"While we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen: for the things which are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal."
47005003,2 Corinthians,5,3,If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
47005004,2 Corinthians,5,4,"For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed upon, that mortality might be swallowed up of life."
47005006,2 Corinthians,5,6,"Therefore we are always confident, knowing that, whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:"
47005009,2 Corinthians,5,9,"Wherefore we labour, that, whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him."
47005015,2 Corinthians,5,15,"And that he died for all, that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them, and rose again."
47005016,2 Corinthians,5,16,"Wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh: yea, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more."
47005021,2 Corinthians,5,21,"For he hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him."
47006005,2 Corinthians,6,5,"In stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in watchings, in fastings;"
47006006,2 Corinthians,6,6,"By pureness, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Ghost, by love unfeigned,"
47006007,2 Corinthians,6,7,"By the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteousness on the right hand and on the left,"
47006008,2 Corinthians,6,8,"By honour and dishonour, by evil report and good report: as deceivers, and yet true;"
47006009,2 Corinthians,6,9,"As unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and, behold, we live; as chastened, and not killed;"
47006011,2 Corinthians,6,11,"O ye Corinthians, our mouth is open unto you, our heart is enlarged."
47006012,2 Corinthians,6,12,"Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own bowels."
47006014,2 Corinthians,6,14,Be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion hath light with darkness?
47006015,2 Corinthians,6,15,And what concord hath Christ with Belial? or what part hath he that believeth with an infidel?
47006016,2 Corinthians,6,16,"And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people."
47007001,2 Corinthians,7,1,"Having therefore these promises, dearly beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God."
47007003,2 Corinthians,7,3,"I speak not this to condemn you: for I have said before, that ye are in our hearts to die and live with you."
47007004,2 Corinthians,7,4,"Great is my boldness of speech toward you, great is my glorying of you: I am filled with comfort, I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation."
47007005,2 Corinthians,7,5,"For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fightings, within were fears."
47007006,2 Corinthians,7,6,"Nevertheless God, that comforteth those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;"
47007007,2 Corinthians,7,7,"And not by his coming only, but by the consolation wherewith he was comforted in you, when he told us your earnest desire, your mourning, your fervent mind toward me; so that I rejoiced the more."
47007011,2 Corinthians,7,11,"For behold this selfsame thing, that ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in you, yea, what clearing of yourselves, yea, what indignation, yea, what fear, yea, what vehement desire, yea, what zeal, yea, what revenge! In all things ye have approved yourselves to be clear in this matter."
47007012,2 Corinthians,7,12,"Wherefore, though I wrote unto you, I did it not for his cause that had done the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered wrong, but that our care for you in the sight of God might appear unto you."
47008001,2 Corinthians,8,1,"Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;"
47008002,2 Corinthians,8,2,How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.
47008003,2 Corinthians,8,3,"For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;"
47008006,2 Corinthians,8,6,"Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also."
47008009,2 Corinthians,8,9,"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich."
47008010,2 Corinthians,8,10,"And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago."
47008011,2 Corinthians,8,11,"Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have."
47008012,2 Corinthians,8,12,"For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not."
47008014,2 Corinthians,8,14,"But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:"
47008017,2 Corinthians,8,17,"For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you."
47008018,2 Corinthians,8,18,"And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;"
47008019,2 Corinthians,8,19,"And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:"
47008020,2 Corinthians,8,20,"Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:"
47008022,2 Corinthians,8,22,"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you."
47008023,2 Corinthians,8,23,"Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ."
47008024,2 Corinthians,8,24,"Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf."
47009001,2 Corinthians,9,1,"For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:"
47009002,2 Corinthians,9,2,"For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many."
47009003,2 Corinthians,9,3,"Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:"
47009004,2 Corinthians,9,4,"Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting."
47009006,2 Corinthians,9,6,"But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully."
47009007,2 Corinthians,9,7,"Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver."
47009008,2 Corinthians,9,8,"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:"
47009009,2 Corinthians,9,9,"(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever."
47009011,2 Corinthians,9,11,"Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God."
47009014,2 Corinthians,9,14,"And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you."
47010001,2 Corinthians,10,1,"Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:"
47010004,2 Corinthians,10,4,"(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)"
47010005,2 Corinthians,10,5,"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;"
47010006,2 Corinthians,10,6,"And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled."
47010007,2 Corinthians,10,7,"Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's."
47010009,2 Corinthians,10,9,That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.
47010010,2 Corinthians,10,10,"For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible."
47010012,2 Corinthians,10,12,"For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise."
47010013,2 Corinthians,10,13,"But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you."
47010015,2 Corinthians,10,15,"Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,"
47010017,2 Corinthians,10,17,"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord."
47011002,2 Corinthians,11,2,"For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ."
47011005,2 Corinthians,11,5,For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.
47011006,2 Corinthians,11,6,"But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things."
47011007,2 Corinthians,11,7,"Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?"
47011008,2 Corinthians,11,8,"I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service."
47011011,2 Corinthians,11,11,Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.
47011012,2 Corinthians,11,12,"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we."
47011013,2 Corinthians,11,13,"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ."
47011014,2 Corinthians,11,14,And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.
47011015,2 Corinthians,11,15,Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.
47011016,2 Corinthians,11,16,"I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little."
47011017,2 Corinthians,11,17,"That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting."
47011019,2 Corinthians,11,19,"For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise."
47011020,2 Corinthians,11,20,"For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face."
47011022,2 Corinthians,11,22,Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.
47011025,2 Corinthians,11,25,"Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;"
47011026,2 Corinthians,11,26,"In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;"
47011027,2 Corinthians,11,27,"In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness."
47011030,2 Corinthians,11,30,"If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities."
47011031,2 Corinthians,11,31,"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not."
47012002,2 Corinthians,12,2,"I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven."
47012004,2 Corinthians,12,4,"How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter."
47012005,2 Corinthians,12,5,"Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities."
47012007,2 Corinthians,12,7,"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure."
47012008,2 Corinthians,12,8,"For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me."
47012009,2 Corinthians,12,9,"And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me."
47012010,2 Corinthians,12,10,"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong."
47012011,2 Corinthians,12,11,"I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing."
47012012,2 Corinthians,12,12,"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds."
47012013,2 Corinthians,12,13,"For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong."
47012014,2 Corinthians,12,14,"Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children."
47012015,2 Corinthians,12,15,"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved."
47012016,2 Corinthians,12,16,"But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile."
47012021,2 Corinthians,12,21,"And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed."
47013001,2 Corinthians,13,1,This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.
47013002,2 Corinthians,13,2,"I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:"
47013005,2 Corinthians,13,5,"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?"
47013007,2 Corinthians,13,7,"Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates."
47013008,2 Corinthians,13,8,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth."
47013010,2 Corinthians,13,10,"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction."
47013013,2 Corinthians,13,13,All the saints salute you.
47013014,2 Corinthians,13,14,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen."
48001002,Galatians,1,2,"And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:"
48001004,Galatians,1,4,"Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:"
48001005,Galatians,1,5,To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
48001010,Galatians,1,10,"For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ."
48001015,Galatians,1,15,"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,"
48001017,Galatians,1,17,"Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus."
48001020,Galatians,1,20,"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not."
48001023,Galatians,1,23,"But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed."
48002001,Galatians,2,1,"Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also."
48002003,Galatians,2,3,"But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:"
48002005,Galatians,2,5,"To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you."
48002006,Galatians,2,6,"But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:"
48002007,Galatians,2,7,"But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;"
48002009,Galatians,2,9,"And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision."
48002010,Galatians,2,10,Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.
48002012,Galatians,2,12,"For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision."
48002014,Galatians,2,14,"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?"
48002015,Galatians,2,15,"We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,"
48002016,Galatians,2,16,"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified."
48002018,Galatians,2,18,"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor."
48002020,Galatians,2,20,"I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me."
48002021,Galatians,2,21,"I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain."
48003001,Galatians,3,1,"O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?"
48003003,Galatians,3,3,"Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?"
48003004,Galatians,3,4,Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.
48003005,Galatians,3,5,"He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"
48003007,Galatians,3,7,"Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham."
48003009,Galatians,3,9,So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.
48003011,Galatians,3,11,"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith."
48003013,Galatians,3,13,"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:"
48003014,Galatians,3,14,That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
48003016,Galatians,3,16,"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ."
48003018,Galatians,3,18,"For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise."
48003020,Galatians,3,20,"Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one."
48003025,Galatians,3,25,"But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster."
48003026,Galatians,3,26,For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.
48003029,Galatians,3,29,"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise."
48004005,Galatians,4,5,"To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons."
48004007,Galatians,4,7,"Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ."
48004008,Galatians,4,8,"Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods."
48004011,Galatians,4,11,"I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain."
48004012,Galatians,4,12,"Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all."
48004013,Galatians,4,13,Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.
48004016,Galatians,4,16,"Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?"
48004020,Galatians,4,20,"I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you."
48004021,Galatians,4,21,"Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?"
48004023,Galatians,4,23,But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.
48004025,Galatians,4,25,"For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children."
48004028,Galatians,4,28,"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise."
48004031,Galatians,4,31,"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free."
48005001,Galatians,5,1,"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage."
48005003,Galatians,5,3,"For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law."
48005004,Galatians,5,4,"Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace."
48005005,Galatians,5,5,For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.
48005006,Galatians,5,6,"For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love."
48005010,Galatians,5,10,"I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be."
48005012,Galatians,5,12,I would they were even cut off which trouble you.
48005013,Galatians,5,13,"For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another."
48005014,Galatians,5,14,"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself."
48005015,Galatians,5,15,"But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another."
48005016,Galatians,5,16,"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh."
48005018,Galatians,5,18,"But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law."
48005021,Galatians,5,21,"Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."
48005022,Galatians,5,22,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,"
48005023,Galatians,5,23,"Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law."
48005024,Galatians,5,24,And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.
48005026,Galatians,5,26,"Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another."
48006002,Galatians,6,2,"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ."
48006003,Galatians,6,3,"For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself."
48006004,Galatians,6,4,"But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another."
48006005,Galatians,6,5,For every man shall bear his own burden.
48006006,Galatians,6,6,Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.
48006008,Galatians,6,8,For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.
48006009,Galatians,6,9,"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not."
48006012,Galatians,6,12,"As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ."
48006015,Galatians,6,15,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature."
48006016,Galatians,6,16,"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God."
48006017,Galatians,6,17,From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.
50001001,Philippians,1,1,"Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:"
50001002,Philippians,1,2,"Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
50001004,Philippians,1,4,"Always in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,"
50001005,Philippians,1,5,For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
50001006,Philippians,1,6,"Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ:"
50001008,Philippians,1,8,"For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ."
50001010,Philippians,1,10,That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.
50001012,Philippians,1,12,"But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;"
50001014,Philippians,1,14,"And many of the brethren in the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much more bold to speak the word without fear."
50001016,Philippians,1,16,"The one preach Christ of contention, not sincerely, supposing to add affliction to my bonds:"
50001019,Philippians,1,19,"For I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,"
50001022,Philippians,1,22,"But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not."
50001023,Philippians,1,23,"For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:"
50001025,Philippians,1,25,"And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;"
50001027,Philippians,1,27,"Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;"
50001028,Philippians,1,28,"And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God."
50001030,Philippians,1,30,"Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me."
50002003,Philippians,2,3,Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.
50002006,Philippians,2,6,"Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God:"
50002007,Philippians,2,7,"But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:"
50002010,Philippians,2,10,"That at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth;"
50002011,Philippians,2,11,"And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father."
50002012,Philippians,2,12,"Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling."
50002014,Philippians,2,14,Do all things without murmurings and disputings:
50002019,Philippians,2,19,"But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state."
50002020,Philippians,2,20,"For I have no man likeminded, who will naturally care for your state."
50002021,Philippians,2,21,"For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's."
50002022,Philippians,2,22,"But ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel."
50002026,Philippians,2,26,"For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that ye had heard that he had been sick."
50002027,Philippians,2,27,"For indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow."
50002029,Philippians,2,29,Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:
50002030,Philippians,2,30,"Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me."
50003001,Philippians,3,1,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe."
50003002,Philippians,3,2,"Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision."
50003003,Philippians,3,3,"For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh."
50003004,Philippians,3,4,"Though I might also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more:"
50003007,Philippians,3,7,"But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ."
50003008,Philippians,3,8,"Yea doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,"
50003009,Philippians,3,9,"And be found in him, not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:"
50003012,Philippians,3,12,"Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus."
50003015,Philippians,3,15,"Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you."
50003016,Philippians,3,16,"Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing."
50003017,Philippians,3,17,"Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample."
50003020,Philippians,3,20,"For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:"
50004003,Philippians,4,3,"And I intreat thee also, true yokefellow, help those women which laboured with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellowlabourers, whose names are in the book of life."
50004004,Philippians,4,4,"Rejoice in the Lord alway: and again I say, Rejoice."
50004005,Philippians,4,5,Let your moderation be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.
50004006,Philippians,4,6,Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.
50004007,Philippians,4,7,"And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."
50004010,Philippians,4,10,"But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me hath flourished again; wherein ye were also careful, but ye lacked opportunity."
50004016,Philippians,4,16,For even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my necessity.
50004017,Philippians,4,17,Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.
50004019,Philippians,4,19,But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
50004022,Philippians,4,22,"All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household."
50004023,Philippians,4,23,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
52001001,1 Thessalonians,1,1,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians which is in God the Father and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."
52001004,1 Thessalonians,1,4,"Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God."
52001006,1 Thessalonians,1,6,"And ye became followers of us, and of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost."
52001007,1 Thessalonians,1,7,So that ye were ensamples to all that believe in Macedonia and Achaia.
52001009,1 Thessalonians,1,9,"For they themselves shew of us what manner of entering in we had unto you, and how ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God;"
52001010,1 Thessalonians,1,10,"And to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come."
52002002,1 Thessalonians,2,2,"But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as ye know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you the gospel of God with much contention."
52002005,1 Thessalonians,2,5,"For neither at any time used we flattering words, as ye know, nor a cloke of covetousness; God is witness:"
52002006,1 Thessalonians,2,6,"Nor of men sought we glory, neither of you, nor yet of others, when we might have been burdensome, as the apostles of Christ."
52002007,1 Thessalonians,2,7,"But we were gentle among you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children:"
52002008,1 Thessalonians,2,8,"So being affectionately desirous of you, we were willing to have imparted unto you, not the gospel of God only, but also our own souls, because ye were dear unto us."
52002011,1 Thessalonians,2,11,"As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,"
52002013,1 Thessalonians,2,13,"For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe."
52002014,1 Thessalonians,2,14,"For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:"
52002016,1 Thessalonians,2,16,"Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost."
52002019,1 Thessalonians,2,19,"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?"
52003001,1 Thessalonians,3,1,"Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;"
52003002,1 Thessalonians,3,2,"And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:"
52003004,1 Thessalonians,3,4,"For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know."
52003008,1 Thessalonians,3,8,"For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord."
52003009,1 Thessalonians,3,9,"For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;"
52003010,1 Thessalonians,3,10,"Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?"
52003012,1 Thessalonians,3,12,"And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:"
52003013,1 Thessalonians,3,13,"To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints."
52004001,1 Thessalonians,4,1,"Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more."
52004002,1 Thessalonians,4,2,For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.
52004003,1 Thessalonians,4,3,"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:"
52004004,1 Thessalonians,4,4,That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;
52004005,1 Thessalonians,4,5,"Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:"
52004006,1 Thessalonians,4,6,"That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified."
52004008,1 Thessalonians,4,8,"He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit."
52004009,1 Thessalonians,4,9,But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.
52004010,1 Thessalonians,4,10,"And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;"
52004011,1 Thessalonians,4,11,"And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;"
52004012,1 Thessalonians,4,12,"That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing."
52004013,1 Thessalonians,4,13,"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope."
52005001,1 Thessalonians,5,1,"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you."
52005004,1 Thessalonians,5,4,"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief."
52005005,1 Thessalonians,5,5,"Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness."
52005009,1 Thessalonians,5,9,"For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,"
52005010,1 Thessalonians,5,10,"Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him."
52005011,1 Thessalonians,5,11,"Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do."
52005012,1 Thessalonians,5,12,"And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;"
52005013,1 Thessalonians,5,13,And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.
52005015,1 Thessalonians,5,15,"See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men."
52005018,1 Thessalonians,5,18,In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.
52005019,1 Thessalonians,5,19,Quench not the Spirit.
52005020,1 Thessalonians,5,20,Despise not prophesyings.
52005021,1 Thessalonians,5,21,Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.
52005022,1 Thessalonians,5,22,Abstain from all appearance of evil.
52005024,1 Thessalonians,5,24,"Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it."
52005025,1 Thessalonians,5,25,"Brethren, pray for us."
52005027,1 Thessalonians,5,27,I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.
57001001,Philemon,1,1,"Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother, unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,"
57001002,Philemon,1,2,"And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier, and to the church in thy house:"
57001005,Philemon,1,5,"Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord Jesus, and toward all saints;"
57001007,Philemon,1,7,"For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother."
57001008,Philemon,1,8,"Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin thee that which is convenient,"
57001009,Philemon,1,9,"Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ."
57001010,Philemon,1,10,"I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my bonds:"
57001012,Philemon,1,12,"Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is, mine own bowels:"
57001013,Philemon,1,13,"Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:"
57001014,Philemon,1,14,"But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly."
57001015,Philemon,1,15,"For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever;"
57001016,Philemon,1,16,"Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved, specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the flesh, and in the Lord?"
57001017,Philemon,1,17,"If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself."
57001018,Philemon,1,18,"If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account;"
57001019,Philemon,1,19,"I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it: albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine own self besides."
57001020,Philemon,1,20,"Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord."
57001021,Philemon,1,21,"Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing that thou wilt also do more than I say."
57001022,Philemon,1,22,But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through your prayers I shall be given unto you.
57001024,Philemon,1,24,"Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers."
57001025,Philemon,1,25,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.
