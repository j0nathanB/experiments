45003027,Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay: but by the law of faith.,TRUE

45004005,"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.",TRUE
45004006,"Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works,",TRUE

45004008,Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.,TRUE
45004009,"Cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision only, or upon the uncircumcision also? for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.",TRUE
45004010,"How was it then reckoned? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.",TRUE
45004011,"And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed unto them also:",TRUE
45004012,"And the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.",TRUE
45004013,"For the promise, that he should be the heir of the world, was not to Abraham, or to his seed, through the law, but through the righteousness of faith.",TRUE
45004014,"For if they which are of the law be heirs, faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect:",TRUE
45004015,"Because the law worketh wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.",TRUE
45004016,"Therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace; to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed; not to that only which is of the law, but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham; who is the father of us all,",TRUE
45004017,"(As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations,) before him whom he believed, even God, who quickeneth the dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they were.",TRUE
45004018,"Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be.",TRUE
45004019,"And being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb:",TRUE
45004020,"He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;",TRUE
45004021,"And being fully persuaded that, what he had promised, he was able also to perform.",TRUE
45004022,And therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness.,TRUE
45004023,"Now it was not written for his sake alone, that it was imputed to him;",TRUE
45004024,"But for us also, to whom it shall be imputed, if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead;",TRUE
45004025,"Who was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.",TRUE
45005001,"Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:",TRUE
45005002,"By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.",TRUE
45005003,"And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also: knowing that tribulation worketh patience;",TRUE
45005004,"And patience, experience; and experience, hope:",TRUE
45005005,And hope maketh not ashamed; because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.,TRUE
45005006,"For when we were yet without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.",TRUE
45005007,For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.,TRUE
45005008,"But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.",TRUE
45005009,"Much more then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.",TRUE
45005010,"For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.",TRUE
45005011,"And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we have now received the atonement.",TRUE
45005012,"Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned:",TRUE
45005013,(For until the law sin was in the world: but sin is not imputed when there is no law.,TRUE
45005014,"Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression, who is the figure of him that was to come.",TRUE
45005015,"But not as the offence, so also is the free gift. For if through the offence of one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.",TRUE
45005016,"And not as it was by one that sinned, so is the gift: for the judgment was by one to condemnation, but the free gift is of many offences unto justification.",TRUE
45005017,"For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)",TRUE
45005018,Therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life.,TRUE
45005019,"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.",TRUE
45005020,"Moreover the law entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:",TRUE
45005021,"That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord.",TRUE
45006001,"What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?",TRUE
45006002,"God forbid. How shall we, that are dead to sin, live any longer therein?",TRUE
45006003,"Know ye not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?",TRUE
45006004,"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.",TRUE
45006005,"For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death, we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection:",TRUE
45006006,"Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin.",TRUE
45006007,For he that is dead is freed from sin.,TRUE
45006008,"Now if we be dead with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him:",TRUE
45006009,Knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more; death hath no more dominion over him.,TRUE
45006010,"For in that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God.",TRUE
45006011,"Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord.",TRUE
45006012,"Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.",TRUE
45006013,"Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God.",TRUE
45006014,"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace.",TRUE
45006015,"What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.",TRUE
45006016,"Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness?",TRUE
45006017,"But God be thanked, that ye were the servants of sin, but ye have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you.",TRUE
45006018,"Being then made free from sin, ye became the servants of righteousness.",TRUE
45006019,I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh: for as ye have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity; even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness.,TRUE
45006020,"For when ye were the servants of sin, ye were free from righteousness.",TRUE
45006021,What fruit had ye then in those things whereof ye are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.,TRUE
45006022,"But now being made free from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life.",TRUE
45006023,For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.,TRUE
45007001,"Know ye not, brethren, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law hath dominion over a man as long as he liveth?",TRUE
45007002,"For the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth; but if the husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her husband.",TRUE
45007003,"So then if, while her husband liveth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from that law; so that she is no adulteress, though she be married to another man.",TRUE
45007004,"Wherefore, my brethren, ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that ye should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit unto God.",TRUE
45007005,"For when we were in the flesh, the motions of sins, which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death.",TRUE
45007006,"But now we are delivered from the law, that being dead wherein we were held; that we should serve in newness of spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter.",TRUE
45007007,"What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, Thou shalt not covet.",TRUE
45007008,"But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.",TRUE
45007009,"For I was alive without the law once: but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died.",TRUE
45007010,"And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death.",TRUE
45007011,"For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.",TRUE
45007012,"Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.",TRUE
45007013,"Was then that which is good made death unto me? God forbid. But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me by that which is good; that sin by the commandment might become exceeding sinful.",TRUE
45007014,"For we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.",TRUE
45007015,"For that which I do I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.",TRUE
45007016,"If then I do that which I would not, I consent unto the law that it is good.",TRUE
45007017,"Now then it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.",TRUE
45007018,"For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh,) dwelleth no good thing: for to will is present with me; but how to perform that which is good I find not.",TRUE
45007019,"For the good that I would I do not: but the evil which I would not, that I do.",TRUE
45007020,"Now if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it, but sin that dwelleth in me.",TRUE
45007021,"I find then a law, that, when I would do good, evil is present with me.",TRUE
45007022,For I delight in the law of God after the inward man:,TRUE
45007023,"But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.",TRUE
45007024,O wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death?,TRUE
45007025,I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord. So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God; but with the flesh the law of sin.,TRUE
45008001,"There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.",TRUE
45008002,For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death.,TRUE
45008003,"For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:",TRUE
45008004,"That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.",TRUE
45008005,For they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the Spirit the things of the Spirit.,TRUE
45008006,For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.,TRUE
45008007,"Because the carnal mind is enmity against God: for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.",TRUE
45008008,So then they that are in the flesh cannot please God.,TRUE
45008009,"But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.",TRUE
45008010,"And if Christ be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.",TRUE
45008011,"But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you.",TRUE
45008012,"Therefore, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live after the flesh.",TRUE
45008013,"For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall die: but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.",TRUE
45008014,"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.",TRUE
45008015,"For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear; but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father.",TRUE
45008016,"The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we are the children of God:",TRUE
45008017,"And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.",TRUE
45008018,For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.,TRUE
45008019,For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.,TRUE
45008020,"For the creature was made subject to vanity, not willingly, but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope,",TRUE
45008021,Because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God.,TRUE

45008023,"And not only they, but ourselves also, which have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our body.",TRUE

45008026,Likewise the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.,TRUE
45008027,"And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.",TRUE
45008028,"And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose.",TRUE
45008029,"For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brethren.",TRUE

45010003,"For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.",TRUE

45011025,"For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.",TRUE

45011028,"As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the father's sakes.",TRUE

46001018,For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but unto us which are saved it is the power of God.,TRUE

46001020,Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?,TRUE
46001021,"For after that in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.",TRUE
46001022,"For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek after wisdom:",TRUE
46001023,"But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolishness;",TRUE
46001024,"But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.",TRUE
46001025,Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.,TRUE

46001027,But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;,TRUE

46002001,"And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring unto you the testimony of God.",TRUE
46002002,"For I determined not to know any thing among you, save Jesus Christ, and him crucified.",TRUE
46002003,"And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.",TRUE
46002004,"And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power:",TRUE
46002005,"That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.",TRUE
46002006,"Howbeit we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:",TRUE
46002007,"But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world unto our glory:",TRUE

46002009,"But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.",TRUE
46002010,"But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.",TRUE
46002011,"For what man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.",TRUE
46002012,"Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.",TRUE
46002013,"Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.",TRUE
46002014,"But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.",TRUE
46002015,"But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged of no man.",TRUE
46002016,"For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.",TRUE
46003001,"And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto babes in Christ.",TRUE
46003002,"I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for hitherto ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.",TRUE
46003003,"For ye are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men?",TRUE
46003004,"For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?",TRUE
46003005,"Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?",TRUE
46003006,"I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.",TRUE
46003007,"So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.",TRUE
46003008,Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.,TRUE
46003009,"For we are labourers together with God: ye are God's husbandry, ye are God's building.",TRUE
46003010,"According to the grace of God which is given unto me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth thereon. But let every man take heed how he buildeth thereupon.",TRUE
46003011,"For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.",TRUE
46003012,"Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;",TRUE

46003018,"Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.",TRUE
46003019,"For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.",TRUE
46003020,"And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.",TRUE
46003021,Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are your's;,TRUE
46003022,"Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are your's;",TRUE
46003023,And ye are Christ's; and Christ is God's.,TRUE
46004001,"Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.",TRUE
46004002,"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.",TRUE
46004003,"But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment: yea, I judge not mine own self.",TRUE
46004004,For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord.,TRUE
46004005,"Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.",TRUE
46004006,"And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.",TRUE
46004007,"For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it?",TRUE
46004008,"Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.",TRUE
46004009,"For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men.",TRUE
46004010,"We are fools for Christ's sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.",TRUE
46004011,"Even unto this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;",TRUE
46004012,"And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:",TRUE
46004013,"Being defamed, we intreat: we are made as the filth of the world, and are the offscouring of all things unto this day.",TRUE
46004014,"I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.",TRUE
46004015,"For though ye have ten thousand instructers in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.",TRUE
46004016,"Wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.",TRUE
46004017,"For this cause have I sent unto you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.",TRUE
46004018,"Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.",TRUE
46004019,"But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the power.",TRUE
46004020,"For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.",TRUE
46004021,"What will ye? shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?",TRUE
46005001,"It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.",TRUE
46005002,"And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.",TRUE
46005003,"For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed,",TRUE
46005004,"In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,",TRUE
46005005,"To deliver such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.",TRUE
46005006,Your glorying is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?,TRUE
46005007,"Purge out therefore the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:",TRUE
46005008,"Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.",TRUE
46005009,I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company with fornicators:,TRUE
46005010,"Yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then must ye needs go out of the world.",TRUE
46005011,"But now I have written unto you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such an one no not to eat.",TRUE
46005012,For what have I to do to judge them also that are without? do not ye judge them that are within?,TRUE
46005013,But them that are without God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.,TRUE
46006001,"Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?",TRUE
46006002,"Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?",TRUE
46006003,Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?,TRUE
46006004,"If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.",TRUE
46006005,"I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?",TRUE
46006006,"But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before the unbelievers.",TRUE
46006007,"Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded?",TRUE
46006008,"Nay, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.",TRUE
46006009,"Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,",TRUE
46006010,"Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.",TRUE
46006011,"And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.",TRUE
46006012,"All things are lawful unto me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.",TRUE
46006013,"Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.",TRUE
46006014,"And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.",TRUE
46006015,"Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? God forbid.",TRUE
46006016,"What? know ye not that he which is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.",TRUE
46006017,But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.,TRUE
46006018,Flee fornication. Every sin that a man doeth is without the body; but he that committeth fornication sinneth against his own body.,TRUE
46006019,"What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you, which ye have of God, and ye are not your own?",TRUE
46006020,"For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.",TRUE
46007001,Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.,TRUE
46007002,"Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.",TRUE
46007003,Let the husband render unto the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife unto the husband.,TRUE
46007004,"The wife hath not power of her own body, but the husband: and likewise also the husband hath not power of his own body, but the wife.",TRUE
46007005,"Defraud ye not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that ye may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.",TRUE
46007006,"But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.",TRUE
46007007,"For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that.",TRUE
46007008,"I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.",TRUE
46007009,"But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.",TRUE
46007010,"And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:",TRUE
46007011,"But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.",TRUE
46007012,"But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.",TRUE
46007013,"And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.",TRUE
46007014,"For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.",TRUE
46007015,"But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace.",TRUE
46007016,"For what knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband? or how knowest thou, O man, whether thou shalt save thy wife?",TRUE
46007017,"But as God hath distributed to every man, as the Lord hath called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches.",TRUE
46007018,Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.,TRUE
46007019,"Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.",TRUE
46007020,Let every man abide in the same calling wherein he was called.,TRUE
46007021,"Art thou called being a servant? care not for it: but if thou mayest be made free, use it rather.",TRUE
46007022,"For he that is called in the Lord, being a servant, is the Lord's freeman: likewise also he that is called, being free, is Christ's servant.",TRUE
46007023,Ye are bought with a price; be not ye the servants of men.,TRUE
46007024,"Brethren, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.",TRUE
46007025,"Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.",TRUE
46007026,"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.",TRUE
46007027,Art thou bound unto a wife? seek not to be loosed. Art thou loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.,TRUE
46007028,"But and if thou marry, thou hast not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she hath not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.",TRUE
46007029,"But this I say, brethren, the time is short: it remaineth, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;",TRUE
46007030,"And they that weep, as though they wept not; and they that rejoice, as though they rejoiced not; and they that buy, as though they possessed not;",TRUE
46007031,"And they that use this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of this world passeth away.",TRUE
46007032,"But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:",TRUE
46007033,"But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.",TRUE
46007034,"There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.",TRUE
46007035,"And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.",TRUE
46007036,"But if any man think that he behaveth himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sinneth not: let them marry.",TRUE
46007037,"Nevertheless he that standeth stedfast in his heart, having no necessity, but hath power over his own will, and hath so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.",TRUE

46015010,"But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.",TRUE
46015011,"Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.",TRUE
46015012,"Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?",TRUE
46015013,"But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:",TRUE
46015014,"And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.",TRUE
46015015,"Yea, and we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified of God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not up, if so be that the dead rise not.",TRUE
46015016,"For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:",TRUE
46015017,"And if Christ be not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.",TRUE

46015019,"If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.",TRUE
46015020,"But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.",TRUE
46015021,"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.",TRUE
46015022,"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.",TRUE
46015023,But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ's at his coming.,TRUE
46015024,"Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.",TRUE
46015025,"For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.",TRUE
46015026,The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.,TRUE
46015027,"For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.",TRUE
46015028,"And when all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.",TRUE
46015029,"Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?",TRUE
46015030,And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?,TRUE
46015031,"I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily.",TRUE
46015032,"If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantageth it me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die.",TRUE

46015034,"Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.",TRUE

46015036,"Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, except it die:",TRUE
46015037,"And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:",TRUE

46015039,"All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.",TRUE
46015040,"There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.",TRUE
46015041,"There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.",TRUE
46015042,So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:,TRUE
46015043,It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:,TRUE
46015044,"It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.",TRUE
46015045,"And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.",TRUE

46015048,"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.",TRUE
46015049,"And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.",TRUE
46015050,"Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.",TRUE
46015051,"Behold, I shew you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,",TRUE
46015052,"In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.",TRUE
46015053,"For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.",TRUE
46015054,"So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.",TRUE
46015055,"O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory?",TRUE
46015056,The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.,TRUE
46015057,"But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.",TRUE
46015058,"Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye stedfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.",TRUE

46016005,"Now I will come unto you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.",TRUE
46016006,"And it may be that I will abide, yea, and winter with you, that ye may bring me on my journey whithersoever I go.",TRUE
46016007,"For I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you, if the Lord permit.",TRUE
46016008,But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.,TRUE
46016009,"For a great door and effectual is opened unto me, and there are many adversaries.",TRUE

47002010,"To whom ye forgive any thing, I forgive also: for if I forgave any thing, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ;",TRUE

47003008,How shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious?,TRUE
47003009,"For if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more doth the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory.",TRUE
47003010,"For even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.",TRUE
47003011,"For if that which is done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.",TRUE
47003012,"Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech:",TRUE
47003013,"And not as Moses, which put a vail over his face, that the children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished:",TRUE
47003014,But their minds were blinded: for until this day remaineth the same vail untaken away in the reading of the old testament; which vail is done away in Christ.,TRUE

47003018,"But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.",TRUE
47004001,"Therefore seeing we have this ministry, as we have received mercy, we faint not;",TRUE
47004002,"But have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.",TRUE

47005011,"Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are made manifest unto God; and I trust also are made manifest in your consciences.",TRUE
47005012,"For we commend not ourselves again unto you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that ye may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.",TRUE
47005013,"For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause.",TRUE

47007013,"Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yea, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.",TRUE
47007014,"For if I have boasted any thing to him of you, I am not ashamed; but as we spake all things to you in truth, even so our boasting, which I made before Titus, is found a truth.",TRUE
47007015,"And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembereth the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling ye received him.",TRUE
47007016,I rejoice therefore that I have confidence in you in all things.,TRUE
47008001,"Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;",TRUE
47008002,How that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.,TRUE
47008003,"For to their power, I bear record, yea, and beyond their power they were willing of themselves;",TRUE
47008004,"Praying us with much intreaty that we would receive the gift, and take upon us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.",TRUE
47008005,"And this they did, not as we hoped, but first gave their own selves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.",TRUE
47008006,"Insomuch that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.",TRUE
47008007,"Therefore, as ye abound in every thing, in faith, and utterance, and knowledge, and in all diligence, and in your love to us, see that ye abound in this grace also.",TRUE
47008008,"I speak not by commandment, but by occasion of the forwardness of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.",TRUE
47008009,"For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be rich.",TRUE
47008010,"And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.",TRUE
47008011,"Now therefore perform the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will, so there may be a performance also out of that which ye have.",TRUE
47008012,"For if there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.",TRUE
47008013,"For I mean not that other men be eased, and ye burdened:",TRUE
47008014,"But by an equality, that now at this time your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want: that there may be equality:",TRUE
47008015,"As it is written, He that had gathered much had nothing over; and he that had gathered little had no lack.",TRUE
47008016,"But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.",TRUE
47008017,"For indeed he accepted the exhortation; but being more forward, of his own accord he went unto you.",TRUE
47008018,"And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;",TRUE
47008019,"And not that only, but who was also chosen of the churches to travel with us with this grace, which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord, and declaration of your ready mind:",TRUE
47008020,"Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:",TRUE
47008021,"Providing for honest things, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.",TRUE
47008022,"And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, upon the great confidence which I have in you.",TRUE
47008023,"Whether any do enquire of Titus, he is my partner and fellowhelper concerning you: or our brethren be enquired of, they are the messengers of the churches, and the glory of Christ.",TRUE
47008024,"Wherefore shew ye to them, and before the churches, the proof of your love, and of our boasting on your behalf.",TRUE
47009001,"For as touching the ministering to the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you:",TRUE
47009002,"For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal hath provoked very many.",TRUE
47009003,"Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, ye may be ready:",TRUE
47009004,"Lest haply if they of Macedonia come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not, ye) should be ashamed in this same confident boasting.",TRUE
47009005,"Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brethren, that they would go before unto you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof ye had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.",TRUE
47009006,"But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.",TRUE
47009007,"Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly, or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.",TRUE
47009008,"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:",TRUE
47009009,"(As it is written, He hath dispersed abroad; he hath given to the poor: his righteousness remaineth for ever.",TRUE
47009010,"Now he that ministereth seed to the sower both minister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sown, and increase the fruits of your righteousness;)",TRUE
47009011,"Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causeth through us thanksgiving to God.",TRUE
47009012,"For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings unto God;",TRUE
47009013,"Whiles by the experiment of this ministration they glorify God for your professed subjection unto the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal distribution unto them, and unto all men;",TRUE
47009014,"And by their prayer for you, which long after you for the exceeding grace of God in you.",TRUE
47009015,Thanks be unto God for his unspeakable gift.,TRUE
47010001,"Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, who in presence am base among you, but being absent am bold toward you:",TRUE
47010002,"But I beseech you, that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence, wherewith I think to be bold against some, which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh.",TRUE
47010003,"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war after the flesh:",TRUE
47010004,"(For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty through God to the pulling down of strong holds;)",TRUE
47010005,"Casting down imaginations, and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ;",TRUE
47010006,"And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.",TRUE
47010007,"Do ye look on things after the outward appearance? If any man trust to himself that he is Christ's, let him of himself think this again, that, as he is Christ's, even so are we Christ's.",TRUE
47010008,"For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:",TRUE
47010009,That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters.,TRUE
47010010,"For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful; but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.",TRUE
47010011,"Let such an one think this, that, such as we are in word by letters when we are absent, such will we be also in deed when we are present.",TRUE
47010012,"For we dare not make ourselves of the number, or compare ourselves with some that commend themselves: but they measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, are not wise.",TRUE
47010013,"But we will not boast of things without our measure, but according to the measure of the rule which God hath distributed to us, a measure to reach even unto you.",TRUE
47010014,"For we stretch not ourselves beyond our measure, as though we reached not unto you: for we are come as far as to you also in preaching the gospel of Christ:",TRUE
47010015,"Not boasting of things without our measure, that is, of other men's labours; but having hope, when your faith is increased, that we shall be enlarged by you according to our rule abundantly,",TRUE
47010016,"To preach the gospel in the regions beyond you, and not to boast in another man's line of things made ready to our hand.",TRUE
47010017,"But he that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.",TRUE
47010018,"For not he that commendeth himself is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth.",TRUE
47011001,Would to God ye could bear with me a little in my folly: and indeed bear with me.,TRUE
47011002,"For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.",TRUE
47011003,"But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.",TRUE
47011004,"For if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus, whom we have not preached, or if ye receive another spirit, which ye have not received, or another gospel, which ye have not accepted, ye might well bear with him.",TRUE
47011005,For I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles.,TRUE
47011006,"But though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge; but we have been throughly made manifest among you in all things.",TRUE
47011007,"Have I committed an offence in abasing myself that ye might be exalted, because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?",TRUE
47011008,"I robbed other churches, taking wages of them, to do you service.",TRUE
47011009,"And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brethren which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome unto you, and so will I keep myself.",TRUE
47011010,"As the truth of Christ is in me, no man shall stop me of this boasting in the regions of Achaia.",TRUE
47011011,Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth.,TRUE
47011012,"But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion; that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we.",TRUE
47011013,"For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.",TRUE
47011014,And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.,TRUE
47011015,Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works.,TRUE
47011016,"I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.",TRUE
47011017,"That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.",TRUE
47011018,"Seeing that many glory after the flesh, I will glory also.",TRUE
47011019,"For ye suffer fools gladly, seeing ye yourselves are wise.",TRUE
47011020,"For ye suffer, if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himself, if a man smite you on the face.",TRUE
47011021,"I speak as concerning reproach, as though we had been weak. Howbeit whereinsoever any is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.",TRUE
47011022,Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.,TRUE
47011023,"Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I am more; in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequent, in deaths oft.",TRUE
47011024,Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.,TRUE
47011025,"Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;",TRUE
47011026,"In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils by mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen, in perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren;",TRUE
47011027,"In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.",TRUE
47011028,"Beside those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the churches.",TRUE
47011029,"Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?",TRUE
47011030,"If I must needs glory, I will glory of the things which concern mine infirmities.",TRUE
47011031,"The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which is blessed for evermore, knoweth that I lie not.",TRUE
47011032,"In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:",TRUE
47011033,"And through a window in a basket was I let down by the wall, and escaped his hands.",TRUE
47012001,It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.,TRUE
47012002,"I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.",TRUE
47012003,"And I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;)",TRUE
47012004,"How that he was caught up into paradise, and heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter.",TRUE
47012005,"Of such an one will I glory: yet of myself I will not glory, but in mine infirmities.",TRUE
47012006,"For though I would desire to glory, I shall not be a fool; for I will say the truth: but now I forbear, lest any man should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth of me.",TRUE
47012007,"And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.",TRUE
47012008,"For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.",TRUE
47012009,"And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.",TRUE
47012010,"Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake: for when I am weak, then am I strong.",TRUE
47012011,"I am become a fool in glorying; ye have compelled me: for I ought to have been commended of you: for in nothing am I behind the very chiefest apostles, though I be nothing.",TRUE
47012012,"Truly the signs of an apostle were wrought among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.",TRUE
47012013,"For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.",TRUE
47012014,"Behold, the third time I am ready to come to you; and I will not be burdensome to you: for I seek not your's but you: for the children ought not to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.",TRUE
47012015,"And I will very gladly spend and be spent for you; though the more abundantly I love you, the less I be loved.",TRUE
47012016,"But be it so, I did not burden you: nevertheless, being crafty, I caught you with guile.",TRUE
47012017,Did I make a gain of you by any of them whom I sent unto you?,TRUE
47012018,"I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?",TRUE
47012019,"Again, think ye that we excuse ourselves unto you? we speak before God in Christ: but we do all things, dearly beloved, for your edifying.",TRUE
47012020,"For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found unto you such as ye would not: lest there be debates, envyings, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, swellings, tumults:",TRUE
47012021,"And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall bewail many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.",TRUE
47013001,This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.,TRUE
47013002,"I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:",TRUE
47013003,"Since ye seek a proof of Christ speaking in me, which to you-ward is not weak, but is mighty in you.",TRUE
47013004,"For though he was crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but we shall live with him by the power of God toward you.",TRUE
47013005,"Examine yourselves, whether ye be in the faith; prove your own selves. Know ye not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be reprobates?",TRUE
47013006,But I trust that ye shall know that we are not reprobates.,TRUE
47013007,"Now I pray to God that ye do no evil; not that we should appear approved, but that ye should do that which is honest, though we be as reprobates.",TRUE
47013008,"For we can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.",TRUE
47013009,"For we are glad, when we are weak, and ye are strong: and this also we wish, even your perfection.",TRUE
47013010,"Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord hath given me to edification, and not to destruction.",TRUE
47013011,"Finally, brethren, farewell. Be perfect, be of good comfort, be of one mind, live in peace; and the God of love and peace shall be with you.",TRUE
47013012,Greet one another with an holy kiss.,TRUE
47013013,All the saints salute you.,TRUE
47013014,"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all. Amen.",TRUE

48001002,"And all the brethren which are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:",TRUE
48001003,"Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,",TRUE
48001004,"Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father:",TRUE
48001005,To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.,TRUE
48001006,I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel:,TRUE
48001007,"Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.",TRUE
48001008,"But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed.",TRUE
48001009,"As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed.",TRUE
48001010,"For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.",TRUE
48001011,"But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man.",TRUE
48001012,"For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.",TRUE
48001013,"For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews' religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it:",TRUE
48001014,"And profited in the Jews' religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers.",TRUE
48001015,"But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,",TRUE

48001017,"Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus.",TRUE
48001018,"Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days.",TRUE
48001019,"But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord's brother.",TRUE
48001020,"Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.",TRUE
48001021,Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;,TRUE
48001022,And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:,TRUE
48001023,"But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed.",TRUE
48001024,And they glorified God in me.,TRUE
48002001,"Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.",TRUE
48002002,"And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.",TRUE
48002003,"But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:",TRUE
48002004,"And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:",TRUE
48002005,"To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.",TRUE
48002006,"But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man's person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me:",TRUE
48002007,"But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter;",TRUE
48002008,"(For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:)",TRUE
48002009,"And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision.",TRUE
48002010,Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.,TRUE
48002011,"But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.",TRUE
48002012,"For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.",TRUE
48002013,And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation.,TRUE
48002014,"But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?",TRUE
48002015,"We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,",TRUE
48002016,"Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.",TRUE
48002017,"But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid.",TRUE
48002018,"For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.",TRUE
48002019,"For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God.",TRUE
48002020,"I am crucified with Christ: neverthless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.",TRUE
48002021,"I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain.",TRUE
48003001,"O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been evidently set forth, crucified among you?",TRUE
48003002,"This only would I learn of you, Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?",TRUE
48003003,"Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?",TRUE
48003004,Have ye suffered so many things in vain? if it be yet in vain.,TRUE
48003005,"He therefore that ministereth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, doeth he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?",TRUE
48003006,"Even as Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness.",TRUE
48003007,"Know ye therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.",TRUE
48003008,"And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the heathen through faith, preached before the gospel unto Abraham, saying, In thee shall all nations be blessed.",TRUE
48003009,So then they which be of faith are blessed with faithful Abraham.,TRUE
48003010,"For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them.",TRUE
48003011,"But that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God, it is evident: for, The just shall live by faith.",TRUE
48003012,"And the law is not of faith: but, The man that doeth them shall live in them.",TRUE
48003013,"Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:",TRUE
48003014,That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.,TRUE
48003015,"Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man disannulleth, or addeth thereto.",TRUE
48003016,"Now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.",TRUE
48003017,"And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect.",TRUE
48003018,"For if the inheritance be of the law, it is no more of promise: but God gave it to Abraham by promise.",TRUE
48003019,"Wherefore then serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise was made; and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator.",TRUE
48003020,"Now a mediator is not a mediator of one, but God is one.",TRUE
48003021,"Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could have given life, verily righteousness should have been by the law.",TRUE
48003022,"But the scripture hath concluded all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.",TRUE
48003023,"But before faith came, we were kept under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.",TRUE
48003024,"Wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.",TRUE
48003025,"But after that faith is come, we are no longer under a schoolmaster.",TRUE
48003026,For ye are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus.,TRUE
48003027,For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.,TRUE
48003028,"There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus.",TRUE
48003029,"And if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.",TRUE
48004001,"Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all;",TRUE
48004002,But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father.,TRUE
48004003,"Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world:",TRUE
48004004,"But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law,",TRUE
48004005,"To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.",TRUE
48004006,"And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.",TRUE
48004007,"Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ.",TRUE
48004008,"Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods.",TRUE
48004009,"But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?",TRUE
48004010,"Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years.",TRUE
48004011,"I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.",TRUE
48004012,"Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all.",TRUE
48004013,Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first.,TRUE
48004014,"And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.",TRUE
48004015,"Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.",TRUE
48004016,"Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?",TRUE
48004017,"They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them.",TRUE
48004018,"But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you.",TRUE
48004019,"My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you,",TRUE
48004020,"I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you.",TRUE
48004021,"Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?",TRUE
48004022,"For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman.",TRUE
48004023,But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise.,TRUE
48004024,"Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar.",TRUE
48004025,"For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.",TRUE
48004026,"But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all.",TRUE
48004027,"For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband.",TRUE
48004028,"Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise.",TRUE
48004029,"But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now.",TRUE
48004030,Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman.,TRUE
48004031,"So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free.",TRUE
48005001,"Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.",TRUE
48005002,"Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing.",TRUE
48005003,"For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.",TRUE
48005004,"Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.",TRUE
48005005,For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.,TRUE
48005006,"For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love.",TRUE
48005007,Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth?,TRUE
48005008,This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you.,TRUE
48005009,A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.,TRUE
48005010,"I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.",TRUE
48005011,"And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased.",TRUE
48005012,I would they were even cut off which trouble you.,TRUE
48005013,"For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.",TRUE
48005014,"For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.",TRUE
48005015,"But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.",TRUE
48005016,"This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.",TRUE
48005017,"For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.",TRUE
48005018,"But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law.",TRUE
48005019,"Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,",TRUE
48005020,"Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,",TRUE
48005021,"Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.",TRUE
48005022,"But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,",TRUE
48005023,"Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.",TRUE
48005024,And they that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts.,TRUE
48005025,"If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit.",TRUE
48005026,"Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another.",TRUE
48006001,"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also be tempted.",TRUE
48006002,"Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.",TRUE
48006003,"For if a man think himself to be something, when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.",TRUE
48006004,"But let every man prove his own work, and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone, and not in another.",TRUE
48006005,For every man shall bear his own burden.,TRUE
48006006,Let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.,TRUE
48006007,"Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.",TRUE
48006008,For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.,TRUE
48006009,"And let us not be weary in well doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.",TRUE
48006010,"As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith.",TRUE
48006011,Ye see how large a letter I have written unto you with mine own hand.,TRUE
48006012,"As many as desire to make a fair shew in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ.",TRUE
48006013,"For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the law; but desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.",TRUE
48006014,"But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.",TRUE
48006015,"For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.",TRUE
48006016,"And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.",TRUE
48006017,From henceforth let no man trouble me: for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.,TRUE
48006018,"Brethren, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.",TRUE

50001009,"And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;",TRUE
50001010,That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.,TRUE
50001011,"Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.",TRUE
50001012,"But I would ye should understand, brethren, that the things which happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the gospel;",TRUE

50001020,"According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.",TRUE
50001021,"For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.",TRUE
50001022,"But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labour: yet what I shall choose I wot not.",TRUE
50001023,"For I am in a strait betwixt two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:",TRUE
50001024,Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.,TRUE
50001025,"And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;",TRUE
50001026,That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.,TRUE
50001027,"Only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ: that whether I come and see you, or else be absent, I may hear of your affairs, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel;",TRUE
50001028,"And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.",TRUE
50001029,"For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;",TRUE
50001030,"Having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.",TRUE
50002001,"If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,",TRUE
50002002,"Fulfil ye my joy, that ye be likeminded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.",TRUE

50002007,"But made himself of no reputation, and took upon him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:",TRUE
50002008,"And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross.",TRUE

50002029,Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:,TRUE
50002030,"Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.",TRUE
50003001,"Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.",TRUE
50003002,"Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.",TRUE
50003003,"For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.",TRUE

52002009,"For ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail: for labouring night and day, because we would not be chargeable unto any of you, we preached unto you the gospel of God.",TRUE
52002010,"Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that believe:",TRUE
52002011,"As ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you, as a father doth his children,",TRUE
52002012,"That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his kingdom and glory.",TRUE
52002013,"For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also in you that believe.",TRUE
52002014,"For ye, brethren, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for ye also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:",TRUE
52002015,"Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:",TRUE
52002016,"Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins alway: for the wrath is come upon them to the uttermost.",TRUE
52002017,"But we, brethren, being taken from you for a short time in presence, not in heart, endeavoured the more abundantly to see your face with great desire.",TRUE
52002018,"Wherefore we would have come unto you, even I Paul, once and again; but Satan hindered us.",TRUE
52002019,"For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ at his coming?",TRUE
52002020,For ye are our glory and joy.,TRUE
52003001,"Wherefore when we could no longer forbear, we thought it good to be left at Athens alone;",TRUE
52003002,"And sent Timotheus, our brother, and minister of God, and our fellowlabourer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith:",TRUE
52003003,That no man should be moved by these afflictions: for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto.,TRUE
52003004,"For verily, when we were with you, we told you before that we should suffer tribulation; even as it came to pass, and ye know.",TRUE
52003005,"For this cause, when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by some means the tempter have tempted you, and our labour be in vain.",TRUE
52003006,"But now when Timotheus came from you unto us, and brought us good tidings of your faith and charity, and that ye have good remembrance of us always, desiring greatly to see us, as we also to see you:",TRUE
52003007,"Therefore, brethren, we were comforted over you in all our affliction and distress by your faith:",TRUE
52003008,"For now we live, if ye stand fast in the Lord.",TRUE
52003009,"For what thanks can we render to God again for you, for all the joy wherewith we joy for your sakes before our God;",TRUE
52003010,"Night and day praying exceedingly that we might see your face, and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith?",TRUE
52003011,"Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way unto you.",TRUE
52003012,"And the Lord make you to increase and abound in love one toward another, and toward all men, even as we do toward you:",TRUE
52003013,"To the end he may stablish your hearts unblameable in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.",TRUE
52004001,"Furthermore then we beseech you, brethren, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God, so ye would abound more and more.",TRUE
52004002,For ye know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus.,TRUE
52004003,"For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that ye should abstain from fornication:",TRUE
52004004,That every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour;,TRUE
52004005,"Not in the lust of concupiscence, even as the Gentiles which know not God:",TRUE
52004006,"That no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter: because that the Lord is the avenger of all such, as we also have forewarned you and testified.",TRUE
52004007,"For God hath not called us unto uncleanness, but unto holiness.",TRUE
52004008,"He therefore that despiseth, despiseth not man, but God, who hath also given unto us his holy Spirit.",TRUE
52004009,But as touching brotherly love ye need not that I write unto you: for ye yourselves are taught of God to love one another.,TRUE
52004010,"And indeed ye do it toward all the brethren which are in all Macedonia: but we beseech you, brethren, that ye increase more and more;",TRUE
52004011,"And that ye study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you;",TRUE
52004012,"That ye may walk honestly toward them that are without, and that ye may have lack of nothing.",TRUE
52004013,"But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not, even as others which have no hope.",TRUE
52004014,"For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.",TRUE
52004015,"For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.",TRUE
52004016,"For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first:",TRUE
52004017,"Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.",TRUE
52004018,Wherefore comfort one another with these words.,TRUE
52005001,"But of the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have no need that I write unto you.",TRUE
52005002,For yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night.,TRUE
52005003,"For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.",TRUE
52005004,"But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief.",TRUE
52005005,"Ye are all the children of light, and the children of the day: we are not of the night, nor of darkness.",TRUE
52005006,"Therefore let us not sleep, as do others; but let us watch and be sober.",TRUE
52005007,For they that sleep sleep in the night; and they that be drunken are drunken in the night.,TRUE
52005008,"But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for an helmet, the hope of salvation.",TRUE
52005009,"For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,",TRUE
52005010,"Who died for us, that, whether we wake or sleep, we should live together with him.",TRUE
52005011,"Wherefore comfort yourselves together, and edify one another, even as also ye do.",TRUE
52005012,"And we beseech you, brethren, to know them which labour among you, and are over you in the Lord, and admonish you;",TRUE
52005013,And to esteem them very highly in love for their work's sake. And be at peace among yourselves.,TRUE
52005014,"Now we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feebleminded, support the weak, be patient toward all men.",TRUE
52005015,"See that none render evil for evil unto any man; but ever follow that which is good, both among yourselves, and to all men.",TRUE
52005016,Rejoice evermore.,TRUE
52005017,Pray without ceasing.,TRUE
52005018,In every thing give thanks: for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you.,TRUE
52005019,Quench not the Spirit.,TRUE
52005020,Despise not prophesyings.,TRUE
52005021,Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.,TRUE
52005022,Abstain from all appearance of evil.,TRUE
52005023,And the very God of peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.,TRUE
52005024,"Faithful is he that calleth you, who also will do it.",TRUE
52005025,"Brethren, pray for us.",TRUE
52005026,Greet all the brethren with an holy kiss.,TRUE
52005027,I charge you by the Lord that this epistle be read unto all the holy brethren.,TRUE
52005028,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Amen.,TRUE
