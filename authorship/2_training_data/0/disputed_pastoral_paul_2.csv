54001001,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, which is our hope;"
54001002,"Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord."
54001003,"As I besought thee to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that thou mightest charge some that they teach no other doctrine,"
54001004,"Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do."
54001005,"Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:"
54001006,From which some having swerved have turned aside unto vain jangling;
54001007,"Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm."
54001008,"But we know that the law is good, if a man use it lawfully;"
54001009,"Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers,"
54001010,"For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine;"
54001011,"According to the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust."
54001012,"And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry;"
54001013,"Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief."
54001014,And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.
54001015,"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief."
54001016,"Howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting."
54001017,"Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honour and glory for ever and ever. Amen."
54001018,"This charge I commit unto thee, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on thee, that thou by them mightest war a good warfare;"
54001019,"Holding faith, and a good conscience; which some having put away concerning faith have made shipwreck:"
54001020,"Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered unto Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme."
54002001,"I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;"
54002002,"For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."
54002003,For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour;
54002004,"Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth."
54002005,"For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;"
54002006,"Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time."
54002007,"Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity."
54002008,"I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting."
54002009,"In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;"
54002010,But (which becometh women professing godliness) with good works.
54002011,Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.
54002012,"But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence."
54002013,"For Adam was first formed, then Eve."
54002014,"And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression."
54002015,"Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety."
54003001,"This is a true saying, If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work."
54003002,"A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behaviour, given to hospitality, apt to teach;"
54003003,"Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;"
54003004,"One that ruleth well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;"
54003005,"(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)"
54003006,"Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil."
54003007,Moreover he must have a good report of them which are without; lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.
54003008,"Likewise must the deacons be grave, not doubletongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;"
54003009,Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.
54003010,"And let these also first be proved; then let them use the office of a deacon, being found blameless."
54003011,"Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things."
54003012,"Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well."
54003013,"For they that have used the office of a deacon well purchase to themselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus."
54003014,"These things write I unto thee, hoping to come unto thee shortly:"
54003015,"But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth."
54003016,"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory."
54004001,"Now the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;"
54004002,Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;
54004003,"Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth."
54004004,"For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:"
54004005,For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.
54004006,"If thou put the brethren in remembrance of these things, thou shalt be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto thou hast attained."
54004007,"But refuse profane and old wives' fables, and exercise thyself rather unto godliness."
54004008,"For bodily exercise profiteth little: but godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come."
54004009,This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptation.
54004010,"For therefore we both labour and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour of all men, specially of those that believe."
54004011,These things command and teach.
54004012,"Let no man despise thy youth; but be thou an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity."
54004013,"Till I come, give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine."
54004014,"Neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery."
54004015,Meditate upon these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all.
54004016,"Take heed unto thyself, and unto the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself, and them that hear thee."
54005001,"Rebuke not an elder, but intreat him as a father; and the younger men as brethren;"
54005002,"The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity."
54005003,Honour widows that are widows indeed.
54005004,"But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God."
54005005,"Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusteth in God, and continueth in supplications and prayers night and day."
54005006,But she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.
54005007,"And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless."
54005008,"But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel."
54005009,"Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of one man."
54005010,"Well reported of for good works; if she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the saints' feet, if she have relieved the afflicted, if she have diligently followed every good work."
54005011,"But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;"
54005012,"Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith."
54005013,"And withal they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not."
54005014,"I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully."
54005015,For some are already turned aside after Satan.
54005016,"If any man or woman that believeth have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed."
54005017,"Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in the word and doctrine."
54005018,"For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn. And, The labourer is worthy of his reward."
54005019,"Against an elder receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses."
54005020,"Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear."
54005021,"I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that thou observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality."
54005022,"Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep thyself pure."
54005023,"Drink no longer water, but use a little wine for thy stomach's sake and thine often infirmities."
54005024,"Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some men they follow after."
54005025,Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.
54006001,"Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honour, that the name of God and his doctrine be not blasphemed."
54006002,"And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brethren; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit. These things teach and exhort."
54006003,"If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness;"
54006004,"He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,"
54006005,"Perverse disputings of men of corrupt minds, and destitute of the truth, supposing that gain is godliness: from such withdraw thyself."
54006006,But godliness with contentment is great gain.
54006007,"For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out."
54006008,And having food and raiment let us be therewith content.
54006009,"But they that will be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition."
54006010,"For the love of money is the root of all evil: which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."
54006011,"But thou, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness."
54006012,"Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses."
54006013,"I give thee charge in the sight of God, who quickeneth all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;"
54006014,"That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
54006015,"Which in his times he shall shew, who is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings, and Lord of lords;"
54006016,"Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen."
54006017,"Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not highminded, nor trust in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy;"
54006018,"That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;"
54006019,"Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life."
54006020,"O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:"
54006021,Which some professing have erred concerning the faith. Grace be with thee. Amen.
55001001,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of life which is in Christ Jesus,"
55001002,"To Timothy, my dearly beloved son: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord."
55001003,"I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;"
55001004,"Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;"
55001005,"When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also."
55001006,"Wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in thee by the putting on of my hands."
55001007,"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind."
55001008,"Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God;"
55001009,"Who hath saved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began,"
55001010,"But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:"
55001011,"Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles."
55001012,"For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day."
55001013,"Hold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus."
55001014,That good thing which was committed unto thee keep by the Holy Ghost which dwelleth in us.
55001015,"This thou knowest, that all they which are in Asia be turned away from me; of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes."
55001016,"The Lord give mercy unto the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:"
55001017,"But, when he was in Rome, he sought me out very diligently, and found me."
55001018,"The Lord grant unto him that he may find mercy of the Lord in that day: and in how many things he ministered unto me at Ephesus, thou knowest very well."
55002001,"Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus."
55002002,"And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also."
55002003,"Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ."
55002004,No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.
55002005,"And if a man also strive for masteries, yet is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully."
55002006,The husbandman that laboureth must be first partaker of the fruits.
55002007,Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.
55002008,Remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:
55002009,"Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound."
55002010,"Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory."
55002011,"It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:"
55002012,"If we suffer, we shall also reign with him: if we deny him, he also will deny us:"
55002013,"If we believe not, yet he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself."
55002014,"Of these things put them in remembrance, charging them before the Lord that they strive not about words to no profit, but to the subverting of the hearers."
55002015,"Study to shew thyself approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth."
55002016,But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase unto more ungodliness.
55002017,And their word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;
55002018,"Who concerning the truth have erred, saying that the resurrection is past already; and overthrow the faith of some."
55002019,"Nevertheless the foundation of God standeth sure, having this seal, The Lord knoweth them that are his. And, Let every one that nameth the name of Christ depart from iniquity."
55002020,"But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth; and some to honour, and some to dishonour."
55002021,"If a man therefore purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified, and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work."
55002022,"Flee also youthful lusts: but follow righteousness, faith, charity, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart."
55002023,"But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes."
55002024,"And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle unto all men, apt to teach, patient,"
55002025,In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;
55002026,"And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil, who are taken captive by him at his will."
55003001,"This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come."
55003002,"For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,"
55003003,"Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,"
55003004,"Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;"
55003005,"Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away."
55003006,"For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,"
55003007,"Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth."
55003008,"Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith."
55003009,"But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as their's also was."
55003010,"But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life, purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,"
55003011,"Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of them all the Lord delivered me."
55003012,"Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."
55003013,"But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived."
55003014,"But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;"
55003015,"And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus."
55003016,"All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:"
55003017,"That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works."
55004001,"I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;"
55004002,"Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine."
55004003,"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;"
55004004,"And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables."
55004005,"But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry."
55004006,"For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand."
55004007,"I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:"
55004008,"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his appearing."
55004009,Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:
55004010,"For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus unto Dalmatia."
55004011,"Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for he is profitable to me for the ministry."
55004012,And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.
55004013,"The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest, bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments."
55004014,Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:
55004015,Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our words.
55004016,"At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge."
55004017,"Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion."
55004018,"And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."
55004019,"Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus."
55004020,Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.
55004021,"Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee, and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren."
55004022,The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you. Amen.
56001001,"Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness;"
56001002,"In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised before the world began;"
56001003,"But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching, which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God our Saviour;"
56001004,"To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour."
56001005,"For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in every city, as I had appointed thee:"
56001006,"If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly."
56001007,"For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not given to filthy lucre;"
56001008,"But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy, temperate;"
56001009,"Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers."
56001010,"For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:"
56001011,"Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses, teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake."
56001012,"One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies."
56001013,"This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith;"
56001014,"Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth."
56001015,Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.
56001016,"They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work reprobate."
56002001,But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:
56002002,"That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith, in charity, in patience."
56002003,"The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;"
56002004,"That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their husbands, to love their children,"
