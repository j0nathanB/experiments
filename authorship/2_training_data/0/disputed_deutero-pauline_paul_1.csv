49001001,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus, and to the faithful in Christ Jesus:"
49001002,"Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ."
49001003,"Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ:"
49001004,"According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love:"
49001005,"Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,"
49001006,"To the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved."
49001007,"In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace;"
49001008,Wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence;
49001009,"Having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself:"
49001010,"That in the dispensation of the fulness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him:"
49001011,"In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will:"
49001012,"That we should be to the praise of his glory, who first trusted in Christ."
49001013,"In whom ye also trusted, after that ye heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation: in whom also after that ye believed, ye were sealed with that holy Spirit of promise,"
49001014,"Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, unto the praise of his glory."
49001015,"Wherefore I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, and love unto all the saints,"
49001016,"Cease not to give thanks for you, making mention of you in my prayers;"
49001017,"That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:"
49001018,"The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that ye may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,"
49001019,"And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,"
49001020,"Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,"
49001021,"Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come:"
49001022,"And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church,"
49001023,"Which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all."
49002001,"And you hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;"
49002002,"Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience:"
49002003,"Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others."
49002004,"But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us,"
49002005,"Even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with Christ, (by grace ye are saved;)"
49002006,"And hath raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:"
49002007,That in the ages to come he might shew the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.
49002008,For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:
49002009,"Not of works, lest any man should boast."
49002010,"For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them."
49002011,"Wherefore remember, that ye being in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision in the flesh made by hands;"
49002012,"That at that time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world:"
49002013,But now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made nigh by the blood of Christ.
49002014,"For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us;"
49002015,"Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to make in himself of twain one new man, so making peace;"
49002016,"And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby:"
49002017,"And came and preached peace to you which were afar off, and to them that were nigh."
49002018,For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.
49002019,"Now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners, but fellowcitizens with the saints, and of the household of God;"
49002020,"And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;"
49002021,In whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord:
49002022,In whom ye also are builded together for an habitation of God through the Spirit.
49003001,"For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,"
49003002,If ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God which is given me to you-ward:
49003003,"How that by revelation he made known unto me the mystery; (as I wrote afore in few words,"
49003004,"Whereby, when ye read, ye may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)"
49003005,"Which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men, as it is now revealed unto his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit;"
49003006,"That the Gentiles should be fellowheirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel:"
49003007,"Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power."
49003008,"Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;"
49003009,"And to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery, which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God, who created all things by Jesus Christ:"
49003010,"To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,"
49003011,According to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord:
49003012,In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.
49003013,"Wherefore I desire that ye faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory."
49003014,"For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
49003015,"Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named,"
49003016,"That he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with might by his Spirit in the inner man;"
49003017,"That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded in love,"
49003018,"May be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height;"
49003019,"And to know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the fulness of God."
49003020,"Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that worketh in us,"
49003021,"Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."
49004001,"I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called,"
49004002,"With all lowliness and meekness, with longsuffering, forbearing one another in love;"
49004003,Endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
49004004,"There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling;"
49004005,"One Lord, one faith, one baptism,"
49004006,"One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all."
49004007,But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.
49004008,"Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men."
49004009,"(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?"
49004010,"He that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.)"
49004011,"And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers;"
49004012,"For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:"
49004013,"Till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ:"
49004014,"That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive;"
49004015,"But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:"
49004016,"From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love."
49004017,"This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that ye henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,"
49004018,"Having the understanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them, because of the blindness of their heart:"
49004019,"Who being past feeling have given themselves over unto lasciviousness, to work all uncleanness with greediness."
49004020,But ye have not so learned Christ;
49004021,"If so be that ye have heard him, and have been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus:"
49004022,"That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts;"
49004023,And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;
49004024,"And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness."
49004025,"Wherefore putting away lying, speak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of another."
49004026,"Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:"
49004027,Neither give place to the devil.
49004028,"Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labour, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needeth."
49004029,"Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers."
49004030,"And grieve not the holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption."
49004031,"Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:"
49004032,"And be ye kind one to another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you."
49005001,"Be ye therefore followers of God, as dear children;"
49005002,"And walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweetsmelling savour."
49005003,"But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;"
49005004,"Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks."
49005005,"For this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God."
49005006,Let no man deceive you with vain words: for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience.
49005007,Be not ye therefore partakers with them.
49005008,"For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are ye light in the Lord: walk as children of light:"
49005009,(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)
49005010,Proving what is acceptable unto the Lord.
49005011,"And have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather reprove them."
49005012,For it is a shame even to speak of those things which are done of them in secret.
49005013,But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the light: for whatsoever doth make manifest is light.
49005014,"Wherefore he saith, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light."
49005015,"See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,"
49005016,"Redeeming the time, because the days are evil."
49005017,"Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is."
49005018,"And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit;"
49005019,"Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;"
49005020,Giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ;
49005021,Submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God.
49005022,"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord."
49005023,"For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the saviour of the body."
49005024,"Therefore as the church is subject unto Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in every thing."
49005025,"Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;"
49005026,"That he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word,"
49005027,"That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish."
49005028,So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
49005029,"For no man ever yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it, even as the Lord the church:"
49005030,"For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones."
49005031,"For this cause shall a man leave his father and mother, and shall be joined unto his wife, and they two shall be one flesh."
49005032,This is a great mystery: but I speak concerning Christ and the church.
49005033,Nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself; and the wife see that she reverence her husband.
49006001,"Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right."
49006002,Honour thy father and mother; which is the first commandment with promise;
49006003,"That it may be well with thee, and thou mayest live long on the earth."
49006004,"And, ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord."
49006005,"Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as unto Christ;"
49006006,"Not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;"
49006007,"With good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men:"
49006008,"Knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth, the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond or free."
49006009,"And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbearing threatening: knowing that your Master also is in heaven; neither is there respect of persons with him."
49006010,"Finally, my brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might."
49006011,"Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil."
49006012,"For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."
49006013,"Wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand."
49006014,"Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of righteousness;"
49006015,And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;
49006016,"Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked."
49006017,"And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God:"
49006018,"Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, and watching thereunto with all perseverance and supplication for all saints;"
49006019,"And for me, that utterance may be given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly, to make known the mystery of the gospel,"
49006020,"For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak."
49006021,"But that ye also may know my affairs, and how I do, Tychicus, a beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things:"
49006022,"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that ye might know our affairs, and that he might comfort your hearts."
49006023,"Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
49006024,Grace be with all them that love our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity. Amen.
51001001,"Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timotheus our brother,"
51001002,"To the saints and faithful brethren in Christ which are at Colosse: Grace be unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
51001003,"We give thanks to God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for you,"
51001004,"Since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which ye have to all the saints,"
51001005,"For the hope which is laid up for you in heaven, whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of the gospel;"
51001006,"Which is come unto you, as it is in all the world; and bringeth forth fruit, as it doth also in you, since the day ye heard of it, and knew the grace of God in truth:"
51001007,"As ye also learned of Epaphras our dear fellowservant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ;"
51001008,Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit.
51001009,"For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;"
51001010,"That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;"
51001011,"Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;"
51001012,"Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:"
51001013,"Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:"
51001014,"In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins:"
51001015,"Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:"
51001016,"For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:"
51001017,"And he is before all things, and by him all things consist."
51001018,"And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence."
51001019,For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
51001020,"And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven."
51001021,"And you, that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled"
51001022,"In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and unblameable and unreproveable in his sight:"
51001023,"If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel, which ye have heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven; whereof I Paul am made a minister;"
51001024,"Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:"
51001025,"Whereof I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God;"
51001026,"Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints:"
51001027,"To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:"
51001028,"Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:"
51001029,"Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily."
51002001,"For I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you, and for them at Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;"
51002002,"That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgement of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;"
51002003,In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
51002004,"And this I say, lest any man should beguile you with enticing words."
51002005,"For though I be absent in the flesh, yet am I with you in the spirit, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in Christ."
51002006,"As ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him:"
51002007,"Rooted and built up in him, and stablished in the faith, as ye have been taught, abounding therein with thanksgiving."
51002008,"Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ."
51002009,For in him dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.
51002010,"And ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:"
51002011,"In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ:"
51002012,"Buried with him in baptism, wherein also ye are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who hath raised him from the dead."
51002013,"And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;"
51002014,"Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;"
51002015,"And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it."
51002016,"Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holyday, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:"
51002017,Which are a shadow of things to come; but the body is of Christ.
51002018,"Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he hath not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,"
51002019,"And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God."
51002020,"Wherefore if ye be dead with Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as though living in the world, are ye subject to ordinances,"
51002021,(Touch not; taste not; handle not;
51002022,Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?
51002023,"Which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honour to the satisfying of the flesh."
51003001,"If ye then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God."
51003002,"Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth."
51003003,"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."
51003004,"When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory."
51003005,"Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth; fornication, uncleanness, inordinate affection, evil concupiscence, and covetousness, which is idolatry:"
51003006,For which things' sake the wrath of God cometh on the children of disobedience:
51003007,"In the which ye also walked some time, when ye lived in them."
51003008,"But now ye also put off all these; anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication out of your mouth."
51003009,"Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds;"
51003010,"And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:"
51003011,"Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all."
51003012,"Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering;"
51003013,"Forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any: even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye."
51003014,"And above all these things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness."
51003015,"And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also ye are called in one body; and be ye thankful."
51003016,"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord."
51003017,"And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him."
51003018,"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord."
51003019,"Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them."
51003020,"Children, obey your parents in all things: for this is well pleasing unto the Lord."
51003021,"Fathers, provoke not your children to anger, lest they be discouraged."
51003022,"Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eyeservice, as menpleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;"
51003023,"And whatsoever ye do, do it heartily, as to the Lord, and not unto men;"
51003024,Knowing that of the Lord ye shall receive the reward of the inheritance: for ye serve the Lord Christ.
51003025,But he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong which he hath done: and there is no respect of persons.
51004001,"Masters, give unto your servants that which is just and equal; knowing that ye also have a Master in heaven."
51004002,"Continue in prayer, and watch in the same with thanksgiving;"
51004003,"Withal praying also for us, that God would open unto us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:"
51004004,"That I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak."
51004005,"Walk in wisdom toward them that are without, redeeming the time."
51004006,"Let your speech be alway with grace, seasoned with salt, that ye may know how ye ought to answer every man."
51004007,"All my state shall Tychicus declare unto you, who is a beloved brother, and a faithful minister and fellowservant in the Lord:"
51004008,"Whom I have sent unto you for the same purpose, that he might know your estate, and comfort your hearts;"
51004009,"With Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things which are done here."
51004010,"Aristarchus my fellowprisoner saluteth you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom ye received commandments: if he come unto you, receive him;)"
51004011,"And Jesus, which is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These only are my fellowworkers unto the kingdom of God, which have been a comfort unto me."
51004012,"Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, saluteth you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that ye may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God."
51004013,"For I bear him record, that he hath a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis."
51004014,"Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you."
51004015,"Salute the brethren which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house."
51004016,"And when this epistle is read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans; and that ye likewise read the epistle from Laodicea."
51004017,"And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry which thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it."
51004018,The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.
53001001,"Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, unto the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:"
53001002,"Grace unto you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53001003,"We are bound to thank God always for you, brethren, as it is meet, because that your faith groweth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you all toward each other aboundeth;"
53001004,So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure:
53001005,"Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God, that ye may be counted worthy of the kingdom of God, for which ye also suffer:"
53001006,Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you;
53001007,"And to you who are troubled rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels,"
53001008,"In flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ:"
53001009,"Who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;"
53001010,"When he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe (because our testimony among you was believed) in that day."
53001011,"Wherefore also we pray always for you, that our God would count you worthy of this calling, and fulfil all the good pleasure of his goodness, and the work of faith with power:"
53001012,"That the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified in you, and ye in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ."
53002001,"Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,"
53002002,"That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand."
53002003,"Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;"
53002004,"Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God."
53002005,"Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?"
53002006,And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.
53002007,"For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way."
53002008,"And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:"
53002009,"Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,"
53002010,"And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved."
53002011,"And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:"
53002012,"That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
53002013,"But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:"
53002014,"Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
53002015,"Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle."
53002016,"Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,"
53002017,"Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work."
53003001,"Finally, brethren, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may have free course, and be glorified, even as it is with you:"
53003002,And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and wicked men: for all men have not faith.
53003003,"But the Lord is faithful, who shall stablish you, and keep you from evil."
53003004,"And we have confidence in the Lord touching you, that ye both do and will do the things which we command you."
53003005,"And the Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and into the patient waiting for Christ."
53003006,"Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us."
53003007,For yourselves know how ye ought to follow us: for we behaved not ourselves disorderly among you;
53003008,"Neither did we eat any man's bread for nought; but wrought with labour and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:"
53003009,"Not because we have not power, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you to follow us."
53003010,"For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat."
53003011,"For we hear that there are some which walk among you disorderly, working not at all, but are busybodies."
53003012,"Now them that are such we command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread."
53003013,"But ye, brethren, be not weary in well doing."
53003014,"And if any man obey not our word by this epistle, note that man, and have no company with him, that he may be ashamed."
53003015,"Yet count him not as an enemy, but admonish him as a brother."
53003016,Now the Lord of peace himself give you peace always by all means. The Lord be with you all.
53003017,"The salutation of Paul with mine own hand, which is the token in every epistle: so I write."
53003018,The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
